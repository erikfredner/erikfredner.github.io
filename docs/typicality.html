        <p>With Mark Algee-Hewitt</p>
        <p>We gave this as a talk at DH 2020, <a
        href="https://litlab.stanford.edu/typicality-in-the-u-s-novel/">the
        text for which is here</a>.</p>
        <p>Do literary critics need to know what the typical novel is
        like? Critics routinely turn to moments where novels violate our
        expectations of the form, expectations that have been developed
        by reading, writing about, and discussing novels of all sorts.
        We may intuitively reject the idea of any given novel’s
        typicality—each is, in some sense, unlike any other—yet
        paradoxically rely on a conception of the typical novel as a
        heuristic for other works in the genre. We know when our
        expectations in a novel have been undercut, but in writing about
        a given novel, we tend to focus more on what that undercutting
        does than the origins of the expectation. This project shifts
        the critical focus from the former to the latter.</p>

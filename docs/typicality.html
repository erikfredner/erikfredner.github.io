    <h1 class="page-title">Typicality</h1>
    <p>With Mark Algee-Hewitt</p>
    <p>We gave this as a talk at DH 2020, <a
    href="https://litlab.stanford.edu/typicality-in-the-u-s-novel/">the
    text for which is here</a>.</p>
    <p>Do literary critics need to know what the typical novel is like?
    Critics routinely turn to moments where novels violate our
    expectations of the form, expectations that have been developed by
    reading, writing about, and discussing novels of all sorts. We may
    intuitively reject the idea of any given novel’s typicality—each is,
    in some sense, unlike any other—yet paradoxically rely on a
    conception of the typical novel as a heuristic for other works in
    the genre. We know when our expectations in a novel have been
    undercut, but in writing about a given novel, we tend to focus more
    on what that undercutting does than the origins of the expectation.
    This project shifts the critical focus from the former to the
    latter.</p>

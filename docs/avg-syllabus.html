        <h2 id="description">Description</h2>
        <p>Perennially invoked by politicians and pundits, declared
        “divine” by Walt Whitman, the “average American” has been one of
        the United States’ most important fictional characters for well
        over a century. But do averages tell us anything about the
        individuals from whom they are derived? And who benefits when we
        use the “average American” as a way of saying who represents the
        U.S.? The logic of the average resonates with American
        self-concepts of democracy, equality, and scientific
        rationalism, yet the same data can be used to suppress
        difference and dissent. How does the novel propagate and
        problematize this idea of the representative individual? In this
        class, we explore these tensions between the individual and the
        social by reading two novels—Sinclair Lewis’s <em>Babbitt</em>
        and Richard Wright’s <em>Native Son</em>—in conversation with
        two literary critical approaches: Marxist literary theory and
        the digital humanities methods associated with Stanford’s
        Literary Lab. The course includes an introduction to the
        programming language R for text analysis. As we move between
        close and distant scales of reading, we will ask how numbers and
        texts attempt to represent American personhood. (No prior
        experience with statistics, programming, Marxist theory, or the
        digital humanities is required.)</p>

        <p>Collaboration is a distinctive feature of digital humanities
        research. In that spirit, students will present their work in
        class <strong>before and after</strong> each assignment comes
        due. During the first meeting (referred to as a “lab”), students
        share their initial ideas, arguments, and evidence, then receive
        questions and feedback from the group. This is as much about the
        quality of the ideas you bring to the room as it is your ability
        to help others develop their own. During the second meeting
        (referred to as a “presentation”), students present their work
        in a more formal setting. We discuss matters relating to
        evidence, argumentation, and writing.</p>
        <p>This structure mimics the work of the Literary Lab, where lab
        members develop, present, and discuss their work with
        collaborators and guests, often presenting the same project many
        times as it develops.</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p><strong><span class="smallcaps">Assignment
        one:</span></strong> Select an excerpt from <em>Babbitt</em> and
        explore its relation to one of the themes the novel engages (700
        words, not including the text of the excerpt). Then, reflect on
        the representativeness of the passage in relation to the novel
        or theme. Describe the concept of representativeness used in the
        analysis (300 words).</p>
        <p><strong><span class="smallcaps">Assignment
        two:</span></strong> Select any concept within the realm of this
        course. Then, explicate it by (1) describing its ideal type and
        (2) identifying a manifestation of the concept in either novel
        on the syllabus, noting the ways in which its appearance accords
        with or breaks from its ideal type (700 words).<br />
        Then, students will discuss whether their concept could be
        operationalized, and, if so, venture how it might be done (300
        words). Assignment two may be revised and integrated into the
        final paper.</p>
        <p><strong><span class="smallcaps">Assignment
        three:</span></strong> Students will make use of a concept from
        this class (preferably but not necessarily the one from
        assignment two) in order to study a novel and/or a corpus of
        novels from the postbellum period in a research paper. Students
        will read distantly using a corpus of American fiction in order
        to provide at least one piece of evidence for their
        argument.<br />
        The distant reading component of this paper can be major or
        minor. A paper with a major distant reading component might
        operationalize a concept and analyze the results of the
        experiment. A paper with a minor distant reading component might
        use one graph as evidence in their argument (4,000 words).
        Neither is favored over the other.<br />
        If a student’s project requires a more complex study than the
        time of the quarter allows, students can supplement the distant
        reading component of the final paper with a study design
        proposal. (1,000 additional words, including question,
        hypothesis, description of corpus and method, and the
        relationship between the question and the argument of the final
        paper.)</p>
        <p><strong><span class="smallcaps">At some point during the
        quarter:</span></strong> Students attend one meeting of the
        Literary Lab. Students will be provided with the schedule of
        events near the start of the quarter. (If a student’s academic
        schedule prevents them from attending, accommodations will be
        made.)</p>

        <p><strong>WISE</strong></p>
        <p>Although each WISE (Writing Intensive Seminar in English) is
        unique, all WISE classes share fundamental learning goals that
        fulfill both the WIM (Writing in the Major) requirement for
        English majors and the university’s Aesthetic and Interpretive
        Inquiry (AII) Way. In all WISE classes, students will explore
        and analyze literary texts (and in some cases other cultural
        objects), along with critical or theoretical pieces selected to
        support students’ investigations of primary readings and to
        offer models of inquiry and writing in the field of literary
        study. Students will also advance their own analytical,
        research, and writing skills through a structured series of
        assignments that includes: at least one assignment developing
        close reading skills; at least one assignment engaging critical
        or theoretical writings; and a final essay, developed in stages,
        that investigates primary texts, and that draws in relevant
        critical or historical sources, to produce a synthesized,
        original argument.</p>
        <p><strong>Honor Code</strong></p>
        <p>The Honor Code is the university's statement on academic
        integrity, written by students in 1921. It articulates
        university expectations of students and faculty in establishing
        and maintaining the highest standards in academic work. The
        Honor Code is an undertaking of the students, individually and
        collectively:</p>
        <ol type="1">
        <li><p>that they will not give or receive aid in examinations;
        that they will not give or receive unpermitted aid in class
        work, in the preparation of reports, or in any other work that
        is to be used by the instructor as the basis of
        grading;</p></li>
        <li><p>that they will do their share and take an active part in
        seeing to it that others as well as themselves uphold the spirit
        and letter of the Honor Code.</p></li>
        <li><p>The faculty on its part manifests its confidence in the
        honor of its students by refraining from proctoring examinations
        and from taking unusual and unreasonable precautions to prevent
        the forms of dishonesty mentioned above. The faculty will also
        avoid, as far as practicable, academic procedures that create
        temptations to violate the Honor Code.</p></li>
        <li><p>While the faculty alone has the right and obligation to
        set academic requirements, the students and faculty will work
        together to establish optimal conditions for honorable academic
        work.</p></li>
        </ol>
        <p>The fundamental standard is also a key part of fostering a
        discussion environment built on trust and creativity:</p>
        <ol type="1">
        <li><p>Students are expected to respect and uphold the rights
        and dignity of others regardless of race, color, national or
        ethnic origin, sex, age, disability, religion, sexual
        orientation, gender identity, or socio-economic status.</p></li>
        <li><p>Students are expected to uphold the integrity of the
        university as a community of scholars in which free speech is
        available to all and intellectual honesty is demanded of
        all.</p></li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>Students with Documented Disabilities</strong></p>
        <p>Students who may need an academic accommodation based on the
        impact of a disability must initiate the request with the Office
        of Accessible Education (OAE). Professional staff will evaluate
        the request with required documentation, recommend reasonable
        accommodations, and prepare an Accommodation Letter for faculty
        dated in the current quarter in which the request is being made.
        Students should contact the OAE as soon as possible since timely
        notice is needed to coordinate accommodations. OAE can be
        reached at 563 Salvatierra Walk; 650-723-1066; and/or <a

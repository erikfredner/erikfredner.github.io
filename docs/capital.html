    from 11 million Library of Congress records</h2>
    <p><em>This essay is currently under review.</em></p>
    <p>Literary historians of the United States broadly agree that, at
    some point during the nineteenth century, New York City overtakes
    Boston as the literary capital of the US. What Pascale Casanova
    argues Paris is for world literature, New York becomes for US
    literature.</p>
    <p>Data recently released by the Library of Congress allows us to
    assess this historical claim in new ways, but not in the format in
    which it was originally released. By converting this data to a form
    useful for computational literary studies, I have evaluated this
    geographic shift, and made it possible for other scholars of
    nineteenth century US literatures to use the same data for a wide
    range of purposes. With respect to imprint geographies, the data
    does not show what most literary histories would lead us to
    expect.</p>

    <h1>Elden Ring and Exegesis</h1>
        <p>Below is the accessibility text for my talk “<em>Elden
        Ring</em> and Exegesis,” given May 4, 2023 for the University of
        Virginia Department of English Speakers’ Committee.</p>
        <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
        <p>What does attending to popular analysis and interpretation of
        <em>Elden Ring</em> teach us about the work that we do in
        literary studies? Even though we don’t share objects, these two
        communities of professional readers can learn from each
        other.</p>
        <p>Academics who study literature should learn from popular
        analysis of works like <em>Elden Ring</em> because it teaches us
        something about why people read criticism today, what people
        think the work of criticism is, and helps us better understand
        our discipline.</p>
        <p>Likewise, popular interpreters of <em>Elden Ring</em> should
        learn from academic literary study because, as I will suggest,
        they have asserted certain norms of reading and interpretation
        that academic literary study has long since abandoned as
        definitively impractical and potentially impossible.</p>
        <p>Literary scholars (and their academic presses) would be
        thrilled—if not astonished—to have readers in the thousands. A
        dense thirty-minute YouTube video explaining <em>Elden
        Ring</em>’s lore by the well-known <em>Souls</em> interpreter
        VaatiVidya has 7.4 <em>million</em> views as of this writing. As
        of February 21, 2023, <em>Elden Ring</em> had sold more than 20
        million copies, <a
        href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/news/award-winning-action-rpg-elden-ring-sold-20-million-units-worldwide">according
        to its publisher</a>.</p>
        <p>I’m not comparing these numbers to make the obvious points
        that video games are more popular than literature or that
        YouTube videos are more popular than criticism. Rather, the
        <em>ratio</em> of copies of the work sold to criticism read is
        what seems significant here. This explanatory video has gotten
        about one view for every three copies of the game sold
        <em>globally</em> (this, even though the video is in English).
        Contemporary book sales data is <a
        href="https://www.publicbooks.org/where-is-all-the-book-data/">notoriously
        unreliable and expensive</a>, but it is hard to imagine that 37%
        of readers of almost any text seek out supplementary
        criticism.</p>
        <p>In part, this demand for interpretation is specific to
        <em>Elden Ring</em> and the <em>Souls</em> series, since they
        are interested in difficulty as an aesthetic experience, and
        their most avid players value that difficulty. This description
        plainly applies to the series’s gameplay, but I think it also
        applies to its narrative.</p>
        <p>One widely-discussed anecdote offers a biographical
        explanation for the <em>Souls</em> series’ particular kind of
        narrative difficulty: In interviews, Hidetaka Miyazaki, the
        game’s director, has recalled the experience of trying to read
        Western fantasy books beyond his reading ability in childhood.
        He used his imagination to fill in gaps between the snippets of
        text he understood and those that he did not.<a href="#fn1"
        class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
        role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
        <p>Using this anecdote as a lens to read the <em>Souls</em>
        games, the games’ item descriptions recreate for the player
        Miyazaki’s reading experience: tantalizing concrete details
        coupled with the knowledge that combining the known parts with
        the unknown whole requires acts of readerly <em>imagination</em>
        and <em>interpretation</em>.</p>
        <p>Nathan has more and better things to say on this point about
        difficulty, so I won’t belabor it. But I suspect that there is
        something <em>besides</em> its narrative difficulty explains
        popular interest in interpretations of this work.</p>
        <p><em>Elden Ring</em> is not alone in soliciting such demand
        for interpretation: Other works of popular yet difficult art
        have been subject to a similar kind and degree of hermeneutic
        scrutiny; I would suggest the television series <em>Twin
        Peaks</em> as another example.<a href="#fn2"
        class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
        role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
        <p>Popular interpretive communities that study works like
        <em>Elden Ring</em> and scholarly critics of narrative art
        forms—whether literature, film, performance, or video games—have
        different <em>rules</em> governing the work that they do, which
        is in both cases <em>interpretation</em>.<a href="#fn3"
        class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
        role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
        <p>We already have a history of how such rules have changed over
        time in literary criticism. This is usually presented as a
        succession of temporarily dominant critical approaches that
        emphasize different aspects of texts: the New Criticism,
        post-structuralism, the New Historicism, and so on.</p>
        <p>While these interpretive frameworks are distinguished by
        their different assumptions and priorities, it’s worth noting
        that after the mid-twentieth century, academic literary study is
        indisputably invested in <em>criticism</em>.<a href="#fn4"
        class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"
        role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> By contrast, many of those
        doing what we would recognize as serious interpretive work on
        <em>Elden Ring</em> may not see their work as criticism at
        all.</p>
        <p>Instead, to use a generic term endemic to the internet, they
        might be more inclined describe their work within the confines
        of the “explainer.” One of my main points today is to suggest
        that this impetus for textual study—and the techniques used to
        do it—goes back to a much older form of literary study:
        exegesis.</p>
        <p>It comes as no surprise that different interpretive
        communities have different norms for their core activities. Book
        reviewers who write for popular periodicals like <em>The New
        Yorker</em>, for example, have a professional code related to
        but distinct from that of academic literary critics. Reviewers
        writing about an author’s new book by convention read or re-read
        all of that author’s prior publication to place the current work
        in relation with their body of work.</p>
        <p>This convention is similar to conventions of comprehensive
        reading practiced in academic literary study but it understands
        comprehensiveness differently. If you were writing scholarship
        about <em>Moby-Dick</em>, for example, it might be regarded as a
        greater professional liability not to have read Giorgio
        Agamben’s famous essay on Melville’s story “Bartleby” than it
        would be to have not read Melville’s first book, <em>Typee</em>.
        Periodical reviewers, by contrast, would likely invert the
        relative significance of those gaps in reading, at least for
        purposes of reviewing.</p>
        <p>Just as professional book reviewers and academic literary
        critics have different norms about what one must read before
        writing, so too do interpreters of <em>Elden Ring</em> and texts
        like it have different reading protocols. These range from what
        to read—most famously, item descriptions and their placement in
        the world—to norms about what kinds of evidence are
        admissible.</p>
        <p>For example, it has become normative in the explanatory
        community around <em>Elden Ring</em> (and other FromSoftware
        games) to refer to game assets that, crucially, that <em>do not
        appear</em> in the game as such to aid in its interpretation.
        These include cut lines of dialogue, unused map assets, etc.</p>
        <p>To my mind, this is analogous in literary study to studying a
        poem based on either extant variants—as might be done with John
        Donne—or based on its known revisions, as in the case of
        Elizabeth Bishop’s “One Art,” for which numerous discrete
        revisions survive.</p>
        <p>In both cases, the value of evidence derived from material
        edited out depends to an extent upon the strength of the claims
        made with it. This process is further complicated by the fact
        that modern games receive numerous updates, some of which change
        the text we are attempting to read.</p>
        <p>While not all criticism and study of videogames is done
        outside of the academy, the vast majority of it is. After all,
        the academic study of video games is of relatively recent
        vintage. It was faintly visible in the 1980s, but became much
        more so during the “Are video games art?” debate of the 2000s
        and 2010s.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"
        role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
        <p>Communities that have been interpreting games as works of art
        since the have developed protocols of reading that are related
        to but somewhat liberated from the academic study of other
        narrative forms. As I suggested with my earlier allusion to
        exegesis, however, many of those rules (e.g., an effort to
        produce an unobjectionable account of the fabula and syuzhet
        even when ambiguities prevent it) reproduce in part or in whole
        earlier moments of the history of literary criticism.</p>
        <p>Because of this and following Michael Warner, scholarly
        interpreters of games can perhaps function as a counterpublic to
        this kind of textual study because our protocols of and
        intentions for interpretation are so different from those who
        write and read this criticism.<a href="#fn6"
        class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"
        role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> If the exegetical tradition
        fell by the wayside as interpretation moved from religious to
        secular texts—and thus the notion of <em>indisputably
        correct</em> interpretation became both less urgent and less
        interesting—an apparent return to this mode of analysis tells us
        something about what people think interpretation is for.</p>
        <p>A great deal of this criticism happens on YouTube. While far
        less well known than VaatiVidya, another video speaks to themes
        of this paper and this panel because it argues that <em>Elden
        Ring</em> has reached the <em>limits of interpretation accepted
        by the community</em>.</p>
        <p>A YouTuber published a video titled <a
        href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgpy_-Eeet0">“<em>Elden
        Ring</em>’s Lore is Uninterpretable”</a> in June of 2022. This
        video, which has about a hundred thousand views—large by
        literary critical standards, admittedly small by <em>Elden
        Ring</em> standards—begins by attempting to reconcile some
        interpretive problems that the community had faced in reading
        the game thus far.</p>
        <p>After reviewing several apparent problems of interpretation,
        the narrator throws up their hands and argues that the game’s
        broader themes are uninterpretable because it does not appear to
        be possible for the community to reach <em>consensus</em> on the
        interpretive difficulties that face it. Without that consensus
        on fundamental details of plot and the history of the world,
        they argue, it is not possible to begin interpreting the
        <em>significance</em> of the story.</p>
        <p>I would like to try to name some of the assumptions that this
        argument makes in order to specify what they mean about
        <em>Elden Ring</em>’s interpretive community, and how different
        they are from the assumptions of literary criticism.</p>
        <p>The first is this apparent need for consensus before
        interpreting significance. Literary criticism has long since
        assumed a pluralist relation to interpretation, where the value
        of competing interpretations is measured less by their perfect
        fidelity to the text than by their explanatory value or critical
        utility. Disagreement over interpretive issues large and small
        is expected. No one would give credence to the argument that
        literary critics must first reach consensus about
        <em>Moby-Dick</em>’s apparent contradictions before we can begin
        to interpret its grander themes. I would wager that literary
        critics today would regard efforts at such reconciliation as
        always already doomed, limited in value, or both.</p>
        <p>A second assumption of the video and the strand of criticism
        it represents is that the <em>interpretative significance</em>
        of the game pertains to a comparatively narrow set of objects
        and actors: Minimally <em>Elden Ring</em> itself; somewhat more
        broadly, <em>Elden Ring</em> and its players; and, in what is
        perhaps the broadest interpretation usually ventured, the work
        of its auteur.</p>
        <p>Again, this is distinguished from contemporary criticism by
        its focus on the text as an aesthetic end in itself as opposed
        to a vehicle or occasion to discuss some larger issue in, say,
        literary, political, or intellectual history.</p>
        <p>The “explainer” genre of analysis holds itself to a standard
        that I have taken to calling “comprehensive comprehension.” It
        seeks not only to explain <em>a part</em> of the text, but to
        reconcile the available evidence into an interpretation that
        unobjectionably incorporates as much of the available evidence
        as possible.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"
        role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
        <p>The closest literary critical examples for this vision of the
        comprehensive comprehension would be something like Gifford and
        Seidman’s <em>Ulysses Annotated</em>, a 700-page guide to James
        Joyce’s <em>Ulysses</em> that describes its ambitions as 1)
        pedagogical (i.e., of benefit to the student learning to read
        the text), and 2) as “a specialized encyclopedia” that “enables”
        a reading of the source text.</p>
        <p>These goals are similar intent if not in form to the vast
        majority of writing and community criticism produced about works
        like <em>Elden Ring</em>, especially on sites like Fandom.com
        and Fextralife, both of which are wiki-style encyclopedias
        focused on describing both gameplay and lore details.<a
        href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"
        role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
        <p>What interests me, finally, is that these efforts at
        comprehensive comprehension are justified as the necessary
        preconditions for the interpretation of <em>meaning</em>. But
        attempts to prove or disprove readings of the available evidence
        far outweigh any interpretations based on what limited consensus
        exists.</p>
        <p>In the case of <em>Elden Ring</em>, it seems clear that these
        difficulties will not be resolved before the announced
        downloadable content (DLC) is released, which readers hope will
        clarify issues from the game as it currently exists, and which
        will eventually render the game narratively complete.</p>
        <p>But I think that this process suggests—like the decline of
        the exegetical tradition of literary study—that a more modest
        and piecemeal approach than comprehensive comprehension must
        eventually come to the fore, if only to allow readers to think
        with what they have read.</p>

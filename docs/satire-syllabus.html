        <p>This class at the University of Virginia respectfully
        acknowledges the custodians of the land we are on today, the
        Monacan Nation, and pay our respect to their elders past,
        present and emerging. To learn more about UVA’s past and present
        connections to the Monacan Nation, I recommend <a
        href="https://eocr.virginia.edu/monacan">this website</a> from
        the Office for Equal Opportunity and Civil Rights. To learn more

        <h2 id="engaging-aesthetics-description">“Engaging Aesthetics”
        description</h2>
        <p>This course, one of four “Engagements” courses you’ll take as
        a first-year student, focuses on aesthetics—that is, various
        kinds of transformative encounters with art, literature,
        performance, and environment. Sensibilities that we absorb from
        our social world, our surroundings, and our experiences guide
        our views of particular forms of expression and style over time,
        motivating how we engage with and interpret our world. All of
        us—-as makers of all kinds—-design and curate our daily lives
        and reinterpret our worlds. These aesthetic interventions can
        reveal vital ways of thinking about our present, our past, and
        about whom we might become in the future. A course in “Engaging
        Aesthetics” is intended to help you:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p>describe, analyze, and create;</p></li>
        <li><p>think critically about the nature of art and
        artistry;</p></li>
        <li><p>become aware of how aesthetic experience underlies social
        life and can frame our politics;</p></li>
        <li><p>reflect on the historical, geographical, and cultural
        differences that shape aesthetic expressions and
        hierarchies;</p></li>
        <li><p>and respond to and take stock of the moral and ethical
        capacities of the arts, both in everyday life and at moments of
        social, political, and environmental crisis.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="punching-up-us-satire-description">“Punching Up: US
        Satire” description</h2>
        <p>Satire makes the powerful feel weak and the weak feel
        powerful. It ridicules hypocrisy and points out what we dare not
        say or think. By showing us how foolish and absurd power can be,
        satire suggests that our world can be otherwise. US satire
        skewers distinctions of race, gender, and class as
        self-contradictory, yet undeniably real. Satire can be poignant,
        too. As we all know, laughter sometimes ends in tears.</p>
        <p>In this course, we study American satirists working from the
        nineteenth century to the present. Students will learn about
        these texts and their contexts, focusing on how form and content
        conspire to produce satire. Víktor Shklovsky famously argues
        that great art “defamiliarizes” us with the world. Perhaps no
        mode is more committed to defamiliarization than satire.</p>
        <h2 id="objectives">Objectives</h2>
        <p>By the end of the course, students will be able to:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p>Explain what satire is and is not.</p></li>
        <li><p>Describe and analyze how satirical form and content
        interrelate.</p></li>
        <li><p>Reflect on the historical, geographical, and cultural
        differences that shape our responses to satirical
        aesthetics.</p></li>
        <li><p>Take stock of the moral and ethical capacities of satire
        at moments of social, political, and environmental
        crisis.</p></li>
        <li><p>Express original ideas in discussion, writing, and
        presentations, both individually and in collaboration with
        peers.</p></li>

        <h2 id="commonplace-book">Commonplace Book</h2>
        <p>You will produce evidence of your reading in a course <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonplace_book">commonplace
        book</a> on Canvas. For each reading, you will write three or so
        sentences describing one significant aspect of your encounter
        with the text. Your commonplace book entries are
        <em>informal</em> writing, but they evince good reading.</p>
        <p>Through this practice, we will develop a course culture of
        reading and annotation. We will hold each other mutually
        accountable for good reading through peer review of our
        commonplaces.</p>
        <h2 id="engagements-experience-ee">Engagements Experience
        (EE)</h2>
        <p>As a student at the University of Virginia, you are part of
        an exciting and robust intellectual community. The goal of the
        Engagement Experience (EE) is to make you feel welcomed into
        this community, where you’ll discover new ideas and meet
        fascinating people. The EE is part of the Engagements program,
        existing alongside the Engagement course you are currently
        taking.</p>
        <p>The EE is required for all contracts. Failure to complete the
        EE automatically reduces your final grade in the course by one
        letter (e.g., from an A to a B). There are three components:</p>
        <ol type="1">
        <li><p>Attend the Fall '23 Majors’ Fair as your Engagement
        Experience (more below)</p></li>
        <li><p>Complete an Academic Advising Activity</p></li>
        <li><p>Complete an Engaging Grounds experience (more information
        below)</p></li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>Component 1:</strong> <strong>Engagements Experience
        event</strong></p>
        <p><a
        href="https://virginia.presence.io/event/majors-fair-2"><strong>Majors
        Fair</strong></a></p>
        <p><strong>Tuesday, October 10th, 1-4 pm @ Newcomb
        Ballroom</strong></p>
        <p>Stop by Newcomb Hall Ballroom to connect with more than 50
        majors and academic programs! Get your questions answered, and
        have a walk around to explore your options, all in one
        place! Email Katie Densberger at <a
        href="mailto:kad7k@virginia.edu"
        class="email">kad7k@virginia.edu</a> with questions.</p>
        <p>Even if you think you know what you want to major in, we
        encourage you to visit the Majors Fair with an open mind.</p>
        <p>Note that you will have completed this activity at the end of
        Q1 just prior to the start of your Q2 Engagement class, but it
        counts for Q2.</p>
        <p><strong>Component 2: Academic Advising Activity</strong></p>
        <p>The EE will help keep you on track with your general
        education requirements by asking you to complete one academic
        advising activity during each quarter. These activities will
        help prepare you for coursework in the following semester.</p>
        <p><strong>Component 2:</strong> <strong>Meet with your academic
        advisor</strong></p>
        <p>In advance of registering for classes for the Spring 2024
        semester, you must attend your scheduled faculty advising
        meeting. If you have not received a message from your advisor
        about scheduling these meetings by October 24<sup>th</sup>,
        reach out to them to schedule something.</p>
        <p><strong>Component 3: Engaging Grounds</strong></p>
        <p>Each quarter you will participate in one <strong><em>Engaging
        Grounds</em></strong> experience. This quarter, your Engaging
        Grounds required activity is our visit to the Robertson Media
        Center to learn about podcasting.</p>
        <p><strong>Submitting the EE</strong></p>
        <p>Attest that you have completed all elements of the
        Engagements Experience by writing “On my honor, I have completed
        all components of the EE” under the Canvas assignment titled
        “Engagements Experience” by the posted deadline.</p>
        <h2 id="grading">Grading</h2>
        <p>This class uses <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contract_grading">contract
        grading</a>. Contract grading aspires to be more transparent and
        equitable than traditional grading. It should motivate you to
        focus on the course material instead of worrying about whether
        you have a 92.4% or a 92.6%.</p>
        <p>The main difference between contract grading and conventional
        grading is that the difference between an A and a B is
        determined by <em>quantity</em>. Higher amounts of effort yield
        higher grades.</p>
        <p>Here is how the contract works: You will tell me what grade
        you intend to earn. Then, you will sign a contract stating that
        you will satisfactorily complete a specific amount of work that
        will earn you that grade. You can contract for an A, B, or C.
        Earning an A requires the most work; a C requires the least. If
        you do not satisfactorily complete enough work to fulfill the
        terms of your contract, you may still receive a D or an F. See
        the course contract for complete details.</p>
        <h2 id="email">Email</h2>
        <p>I reply to email within two business days. Do not expect
        replies over the weekend.</p>
        <h2 id="office-hours">Office Hours</h2>
        <p>I host my office hours by appointment to meet with all my
        students, not just those who happen to be available during
        preset office hours. Speak to me before or after class, or email
        me to set up a time. We can meet in person or remotely as is
        mutually convenient.</p>
        <h2 id="health">Health</h2>
        <p>If you are ill and may be infectious, please do not come to
        class. If you are feeling well enough to come to class, please
        wear a mask. Students who miss class due to illness will receive
        excused absences and alternative assignments. Ideally, you
        should notify me of your illness before the class you miss.
        However, if you are unable to notify me until after class,
        please do so <em>as soon as possible</em>.</p>
        <h2 id="artificial-intelligence">“Artificial Intelligence”</h2>
        <p>Put simply, large language models (LLMs)—including OpenAI’s
        ChatGPT, Google’s Bard, and others—use text from the internet to
        predict which word will most likely come next given the prior
        sequence of words in the prompt. LLMs do not “know” things about
        the world. Rather, they make predictions about how words
        <em>might</em> go together based on their training data.</p>
        <p>Because a great deal of the text used to train ChatGPT and
        other LLMs came from Reddit conversations, <strong>I consider
        any interaction with an LLM to be about as trustworthy as a
        random Reddit thread.</strong> Sometimes Reddit posts are
        excellent; mostly they are terrible. You would not and should
        not cite Reddit as an authoritative academic source. You should
        use LLMs in the same way and with the same degree of
        skepticism.</p>
        <p><strong>If you do use LLMs,</strong> all submitted writing
        must be your own original work. Do not copy-paste. You are
        required to acknowledge your use of LLMs through citation.</p>
        <p><strong>How do you cite an interaction with an LLM?</strong>
        If you use ChatGPT, I encourage you to keep all of your
        conversations with it pertaining to a given essay or topic in
        the same “Chat.” Then, when you submit your work, you can cite a
        single link to your interactions with the LLM about this
        assignment. To do so, select the share chat icon (a box with an
        arrow pointing up and out), copy the URL, and cite that URL in
        your submission.</p>
        <h2 id="notice-of-non-discrimination">Notice of
        Non-Discrimination</h2>
        <p>The University of Virginia does not discriminate on the basis
        of age, color, disability, gender identity or expression,

        <p>In accordance with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA),
        as amended, and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, the
        University of Virginia offers an array of individualized
        accommodations and services to qualified students with
        disabilities. Accommodations are determined using an interactive
        process between the student and Student Disability Access Center
        staff. Contact the <a

        Disability Access Center</a> with questions.</p>
        <h2 id="religious-accommodation">Religious Accommodation</h2>
        <p>Students who wish to request academic accommodation for a
        religious observance should submit their request to me by email
        as far in advance as possible. If you have questions or concerns
        about your request, you can contact the University’s Office for

    <h1 class="page-title">The Literary Canon on <em>Jeopardy!</em></h1>
        <p>Critics of the literary canon like John Guillory have long
        argued that the works and authors in the canon change across
        cultural space and time. As a result, they cannot ever be
        comprehensively listed. Yet, if any written list is always
        already incomplete, there nevertheless exist influential proxies
        for important dimensions of canonicity that do list canonical
        authors and works. The contents of literature anthologies that
        lay claim to national, formal, or cultural representativeness,
        such as Norton’s various anthologies, are one key example. This
        essay argues that the literary references—and, crucially, price
        signals—from the quiz show <em>Jeopardy!</em> offer a unique
        proxy for literary canonicity over the preceding forty
        years.</p>
        <p>Pierre Bourdieu famously identified multiple axes of
        canonicity, roughly corresponding to the extent of a work or
        author’s consecration by 1) the market and 2) sociocultural
        elites. <em>Jeopardy!</em> provides evidence for canonicity on
        both of Bourdieu’s axes: On the one hand, it is a popular
        gameshow for a large (and surprisingly diverse) Anglophone
        television audience, which corresponds with the market. On the
        other, price signals surrounding specific questions—the round in
        which a question was asked, its dollar value, etc.—correspond to
        question writers’ subjective probabilities that gameshow
        participants would correctly answer a given question. Put
        another way, price signals represent estimates of how well-known
        or obscure a particular question about a particular text is, a
        clear signal of consecration since <em>Jeopardy!</em> does not
        privilege obscurity as an end in itself.</p>
        <p>Using LLMs, this essay 1) identifies which ~70,000 (~15%) of
        the ~524,000 questions asked on <em>Jeopardy!</em> (and
        documented in an online archive of the show) between 1984 and
        2023 reference literature, 2) identifies specific authors,
        texts, literary forms, and other literary features referenced in
        those questions, and 3) uses question rounds and dollar values
        to weight the significance of a given reference to an author,
        work, or form: low value first round questions signal commoner
        knowledge than later round higher value questions, which signal
        relatively specialized knowledge.</p>

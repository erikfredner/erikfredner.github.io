        <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
        <p>I began the research I’m sharing with you today while writing
        about neither the sociology of reading nor the crises of the
        humanities, but from small discoveries in two big datasets. When
        I first found these datasets, I assumed that they must already
        be widely known. (And perhaps they are to some of the people in
        this room.) But, in general, that turned out not to be the case.
        I want to bring these surveys to the attention of literary
        studies in particular, and scholars in general, for reasons that
        I hope will be both obvious and persuasive.</p>
        <p>Let’s start with three numbers:</p>
        <p><strong>SLIDE</strong></p>
        <p>I’ll explain each of these momentarily. But they make two
        important points obvious: As points 1 and 2 suggest, over the
        past thirty years, the odds of people in the US reading
        literature or anything else for pleasure have gone down by
        almost half. And as the third point makes clear, that relative
        decline is being subtracted from leisure reading rates that
        weren’t very high to begin with.</p>
        <h2 id="census-numbers">Census numbers</h2>
        <p>The US Census Bureau has been collecting statistics about
        reading for pleasure since 1982 in two surveys from which I
        calculated these numbers: the Survey of Public Participation in
        the Arts and the American Time Use Survey. I compiled historical
        data about pleasure reading from both surveys in one place for
        the first time, pulling some figures out of old government
        reports, and others from data newly published in June, and
        performed new analyses.</p>
        <p>My most basic point is that it is bad that the humanities
        generally and literary studies particularly are broadly unaware
        of these figures. Literary studies has been vigorously arguing
        about <em>how</em> to read over the past few decades: surface
        vs. depth, close vs. distant, critical vs. postcritical, etc.
        The significance of those distinctions all follow from an
        unstated presumption about the continuity of reading. Literary
        studies should concern itself more than it presently does with
        <em>whether</em> and <em>to what extent</em> people read. If one
        of the core activities of literary studies is to cultivate and
        improve reading, our ability to do that well depends upon an
        understanding of the present state of reading.</p>
        <p>I have some ideas about why literary studies has ignored or
        repressed this information, but we can talk about that during
        the Q&amp;A.</p>
        <h2 id="the-current-population-survey-cps">The Current
        Population Survey (CPS)</h2>
        <p><strong>SLIDE</strong></p>
        <p>In order to talk about the reading surveys, we first need to
        talk about the Current Population Survey.</p>
        <p>CPS measures labor force participation rates. You are almost
        certainly familiar with its most famous statistic, which is the
        unemployment rate.</p>
        <p>The CPS “is a monthly sample survey of 60,000 eligible
        households.”<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
        role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> It uses a probability sample
        to estimate state and national population characteristics,
        weighting for factors including race, gender, and education.<a
        href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
        role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> Eligible survey respondents
        are 16 or older and neither in the military nor
        institutionalized.</p>
        <p>While the main purpose of CPS is to gather data about the
        labor force, it also fields a number of supplemental surveys.
        The first survey we’ll be looking at comes from one such
        supplement, and the second selects its respondents from the CPS
        pool of households.<span class="citation"

        <p>The research division of the National Endowment for the Arts

        data-cites="marquisNationalEndowmentsArts2013 iyengarAligningArtsResearch2022"><a
        href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"

        used as ammunition in both the reading wars and canon wars.<a
        href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"
        role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
        <p>To the extent that scholars know about the SPPA, it is almost
        certainly by way of the NEA’s reports. The best known of these
        is the 2004 <em>Reading at Risk</em>, which showed broad
        declines in reading.<span class="citation"
        data-cites="ReadingRiskSurvey2004a"><a href="#fn6"
        class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"
        role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></span> More recent reports
        on the SPPA have drawn less controversy. Unfortunately, less
        controversy has also meant less attention. That has been a
        mistake.</p>
        <h3 id="methodology">Methodology</h3>
        <p><strong>SLIDE</strong></p>
        <p>The NEA’s research division studies the impact of public
        participation in the arts on learning, public health, and
        economic activity, among other things.<span class="citation"
        data-cites="Research2023"><a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref"
        id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a></span> That
        means they have two distinct incentives for their surveys.
        First, they want to keep the questions as consistent as possible
        from one survey to the next in order to measure change over
        time. Second, they also need to update the survey methodology to
        accommodate changes that impact <em>how</em> people participate
        in the arts. Obvious examples in the case of reading since 1982
        would include reading on the internet, e-readers, and
        audiobooks.</p>
        <p>The SPPA asks respondents the following questions about
        reading:</p>
        <p><strong>SLIDE</strong></p>
        <p>They only count voluntary reading, not what is done for work
        or school. Religious texts “count as books” for the first
        question. “Reading” is not restricted to the form of the codex;
        this includes e-readers and audiobooks.<a href="#fn8"
        class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"
        role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
        <p>The SPPA makes a distinction between books and what it calls
        “literature.” Respondents are asked if they read any books. But
        they have never been asked if they read literature. Literature
        is the designation that the NEA uses to refer to the set of all
        respondents who reported reading any novels, short stories,
        poetry, and/or plays in the preceding year.</p>
        <h3 id="data">Data</h3>
        <p>With those details in mind, let’s look at the national SPPA
        data for reading any book and reading literature:</p>
        <p><strong>SLIDE</strong></p>
        <p>The y-axis shows the percentage of the US population who read
        either type of writing over the previous twelve months, and the
        x-axis shows the survey year. The dashed line denotes half of
        the population.</p>
        <p>The big drop in book reading from 1985 to 1992 can probably
        be explained by a changed question. In 1982 and 1985, they asked
        if respondents read “any books or magazines.” After 1985, it was
        limited to “any books.” However, the “literature” definition has
        been consistent since 1982.</p>
        <p>Reading literature once (or more) per year had passed from a
        majoritarian to a minoritarian activity by 2012. And, for the
        first time in 2022, the same is true for reading any book in the
        preceding year.</p>
        <p>We can also decompose “literature” into its constituent
        parts:</p>
        <p><strong>SLIDE</strong></p>
        <p>Literature readers and prose fiction readers are almost
        equal. Readers of poetry and plays are much smaller groups, and
        few people in those groups solely read poetry or plays to the
        exclusion of prose fiction.</p>
        <p>You can further subset the SPPA data by various Census
        categories like race, gender, education, and income. Here’s a
        quick summary of what that shows: Educational attainment is the
        strongest predictor of reading. If you were guessing which group
        of Americans were most likely to have read any book in the
        preceding year, you should guess college-educated white women,
        which is no surprise given that they are also book publishers’
        primary market.<span class="citation"
        data-cites="mcgrathBooksRaceCommercial2022 sinykinBigFictionHow2023 daneWhiteLiteraryTaste2023"><a
        href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"

        <h3 id="odds-ratios">Odds ratios</h3>
        <p>While these graphs give us a sense of directionality, it is
        hard to reason about the magnitude of these changes from
        percentages.</p>
        <p><strong>SLIDE</strong></p>
        <p>Odds ratios can help us reason about how big these changes
        are by comparing them to a <em>reference year</em>.<a
        href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"
        role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
        <p><strong>SLIDE</strong></p>
        <p>The odds of reading any book in 2022 are 61.4% of what they
        were in 1992. Put another way, the odds of reading any book in
        2022 are 38.6% less than they were in 1992. This is the kind of
        calculation that I cited in the opening slide.</p>
        <p><strong>SLIDE</strong></p>
        <p>You can read this graph of odds ratios (and the ones that
        follow) by applying the following sentence structure to each
        value: “The odds that a respondent read literature within the
        past year were 44% lower in 2022 than they were in 1992.” The
        story is clearly one of decline—every value is negative—but not
        in a uniform way.</p>
        <p>What remains unclear from these figures is whether the rate
        of decline is increasing, and what the nadir of reading might
        be. The SPPA has been taken at uneven intervals, and drops have
        been jagged. Still, the odds of reading in the preceding year
        are clearly lower than they used to be.</p>
        <h2 id="the-american-time-use-survey">The American Time Use
        Survey</h2>
        <p><strong>SLIDE</strong></p>
        <p>The American Time Use Survey, to which we now turn, gives us
        more detailed information about the extent of reading not over
        the previous year, but over the previous day.</p>
        <p>The ATUS has been conducted annually since 2003, except in
        2020 due to the pandemic.<span class="citation"
        data-cites="ImpactCoronavirusCOVID192022"><a href="#fn11"
        class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"
        role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a></span> It began in the wake
        of a bill that called for a survey to calculate the monetary
        value of unpaid work like homemaking.<span class="citation"
        data-cites="InformationRespondents2015"><a href="#fn12"
        class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"
        role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a></span></p>
        <p>The ATUS’s reading statistics differ from those of the SPPA
        in two key ways, one advantageous and the other disadvantageous
        for my purposes. The advantageous difference is that the ATUS is
        more precise than the SPPA, recording the number of minutes
        respondents read yesterday. Remember that the SPPA asked
        respondents whether they had read in the preceding year.</p>
        <p>The disadvantageous difference is that, unlike the SPPA, the
        ATUS makes no distinction between literary forms.<a href="#fn13"
        class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"
        role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> That said, the reading
        measured by the ATUS includes nonprofessional literary reading
        as a subset of all reading it reports.</p>
        <h3 id="methodology-1">Methodology</h3>
        <p><strong>SLIDE</strong></p>
        <p>Like the SPPA, the ATUS is also conducted on a representative
        subset of the Current Population Survey. One person from each
        CPS household is randomly selected to respond to the ATUS, and
        they report how they used their time over one predetermined
        day.<span class="citation" data-cites="AmericanTimeUse2018"><a
        href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"
        role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a></span> Census workers then
        aggregate specific time use reported by respondents in their
        diaries to more general categories. So, if you say, “I read
        <em>The New Yorker</em> for 30 minutes,” and that’s not part of
        your job, the Census will classify that as “reading for personal
        interest” for 30 minutes.</p>
        <p><strong>SLIDE</strong></p>
        <p>Here are the activities that the ATUS counts as reading for
        personal interest.<span class="citation"
        data-cites="ATUSActivityCoding"><a href="#fn15"
        class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"
        role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a></span></p>
        <p>This list may seem to exclude what N. Katherine Hayles has
        described as “hyper reading,” which is the rapid non-linear
        reading we do on the internet.<span class="citation"
        data-cites="haylesHowWeThink2012 haylesPostprintBooksBecoming2021"><a
        href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"
        role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a></span> Some hyper reading
        might fall under the ATUS category of “Computer use for leisure
        (exc. Games),” and some activities that involve reading—like
        messaging with friends—would be considered socializing. But
        skimming news sites <em>is</em> reading for personal
        interest.</p>
        <h3 id="reading-for-personal-interest-yesterday">Reading for
        personal interest yesterday</h3>
        <p><strong>SLIDE</strong></p>
        <p>We see something similar to the SPPA in the ATUS data: a
        decline in the proportion of the population reading for personal
        interest. However, we begin from a lower point: The percentage
        of people reading yesterday has fallen from about 28% at its
        peak in 2004 to about 16% in 2023.</p>
        <p><strong>SLIDE</strong></p>
        <p>As we did with the SPPA, let us also look at the odds ratios
        relative to the earliest comparable value, which is 2003. Unlike
        the SPPA, not every point in the ATUS data shows a decline. The
        odds were slightly higher through 2006 relative to 2003 before
        they begin to decline.</p>
        <h3 id="reading-vs.-other-leisure">Reading vs. other
        leisure</h3>
        <p>Given the persistent decline after 2010, you’re no doubt
        wondering about the role played by reading’s most oft-cited
        enemies: television, games, and, above all else, the internet,
        especially on smartphones. The ATUS collects data on the role
        played by these during leisure time.</p>
        <p><strong>SLIDE</strong></p>
        <p>This graph shows odds ratios for participation in leisure
        activities viewed as competition to reading.<a href="#fn17"
        class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"
        role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
        <p>Computer use for leisure (which excludes games) and games are
        the big winners. To be clear, this survey does not allow us to
        say that individual respondents are “trading” reading time for
        computing or gaming time. But that is certainly possible. It is
        also worth noting that, over the period of the survey,
        respondents report having as much or more leisure time than they
        had in 2003.</p>
        <h3 id="reading-by-education">Reading by education</h3>
        <p><strong>SLIDE</strong></p>
        <p>While all of the ATUS values presented thus far are weighted
        to represent the US population, they can be decomposed into
        demographic groups.</p>
        <p>When we break out the ATUS data by educational
        attainment—which is the best predictor of reading—we see three
        noteworthy patterns.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref"
        id="fnref18" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
        <p><strong>SLIDE</strong></p>
        <p>First, even as reading for personal interest declines,
        education continues to strongly predict reading. The higher your
        education, the higher the chance that you read yesterday.
        Second, despite the fact that education is associated with more
        reading, the odds of participation have declined for all groups.
        Third, since the ATUS began in 2003, <em>none</em> of these
        educational groups have been more likely than not to read for
        personal interest on any given day. Not reading is the
        default.</p>
        <p>Odds ratios reveal something important about this story.
        Although education continues to predict reading, their changing
        odds ratios are more similar than their baseline reading rates
        are.</p>
        <p>But educational attainment still matters a great deal: Those
        with less than a high school education had an 81% lower chance
        of reading in 2022 than they had in 2004.<a href="#fn19"

        <h2 id="reading-class-vs.-reading-culture">“Reading class”
        vs. “reading culture”</h2>
        <p><strong>SLIDE</strong></p>
        <p>The sociologist of reading Wendy Griswold draws a distinction
        between what she terms a reading class and a reading culture.
        All societies with writing have reading classes, but few
        societies have ever had what Griswold calls reading cultures.
        The reading class is defined by its professional and
        nonprofessional reading, as well as its elite socioeconomic
        status. A reading culture, by contrast, “is a society where
        reading is expected, valued, and common.”<span class="citation"
        data-cites="griswoldRegionalismReadingClass2008"><a href="#fn20"
        class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"
        role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a></span> In Griswold’s terms,
        these declining odds suggest the erosion of the US reading
        <em>culture</em>, which Griswold argues peaked from the
        late-nineteenth to the mid-twentieth century.</p>
        <p>If there is any truth in Griswold’s distinction, disciplines
        like literary studies, which that formed during the US’s reading
        culture, may need to reconceptualize themselves as a reading
        class without a reading culture.<a href="#fn21"

        <p>Griswold has argued that,</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>“professional members of the reading class are evangelists,
        fighting at the front line of culture to convert people to
        reading. Examples include teachers, professors, writers,
        editors, publishers, journalists, and…librarians.”<span

        </blockquote>
        <p>Yet, in my experience, there is little discussion within
        literary studies as to whether the field recruits people to the
        “reading culture,” or preaches to the converted of the “reading
        class.” This is not discussed in part because, without knowledge
        of these statistics, it might be hard to see the difference.</p>
        <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
        <p>I think that these numbers are profoundly difficult for
        professional readers to internalize. Our colleagues, friends,
        and family are unusually likely to be among the 16% of the
        population who read for personal interest yesterday.</p>
        <p><strong>SLIDE</strong></p>
        <p>What, if anything, is to be done? I will not suggest that
        literary studies could or should set itself the task of making
        reading more popular. In the first place, that’s almost
        certainly a losing battle. Moreover, it’s a battle that few
        people in literature departments would want to fight on those
        terms.</p>
        <p>I have no cure, but I do have one suggestion: We know that
        educational attainment continues to be the best predictor of
        reading even as reading declines. What we do not know is whether
        majoring in a field that emphasizes reading is associated with
        more reading for pleasure than what would be expected based on
        graduates’ educational attainment alone. As Griswold suggested,
        reading class professionals work to “convert” new members to the
        reading class. If that idea seems at all objectionable, consider
        the opposite proposition: What professor of literature would
        hope that her students, as a result of taking her courses, would
        read <em>less</em>?</p>
        <p>We should research the differential impact that reading
        intensive majors have on reading for pleasure. We may assume
        that it is obvious that students of literature would do more
        reading for pleasure than students who do not study literature.
        But this is presumptuous. A null hypothesis would be that
        literary studies has <em>no impact</em> on reading for pleasure
        beyond what is explained by educational attainment. If literary
        studies knew its impact on reading, we might be able to evade
        what John Guillory has termed the overestimation of aim.<span

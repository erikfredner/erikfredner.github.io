Literature</h1>
        <p>I coauthored this essay with J.D. Porter. The essay <a
        href="https://doi.org/10.1632/S0030812923001189">appeared in
        <em>PMLA</em></a> in 2024.</p>
        <h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
        <p>We created a database that captures every author and work
        selected for every edition of <em>The Norton Anthology of
        American Literature</em> (<em>NAAL</em>). Given the influence of
        the <em>NAAL</em>, this database reveals changes in the literary
        canon over the past half-century. We find that the common story
        of improved diversity is truer with respect to race than
        gender.</p>
        <p>However, the biggest structural change has been consistent
        and substantial growth in the number of anthologized authors. We
        argue that, while the strategy of growth has produced real
        gains, it also creates a canon that is less effective at
        managing reader attention, that affords women and people of
        color a less valuable position in the canon than their white
        peers once enjoyed, and that tacitly accepts the notion that the
        new additions cannot be aesthetically superior to the original
        roster of mostly white men, whom we show editors too rarely
        replace.</p>

    <h1>Security</h1>
        <p>With Mark Algee-Hewitt, Whitney McIntosh, Stephen Stedman</p>
        <p>Academic, political, and social concepts of “security”
        underwent rapid transformations after the Treaty of Versailles,
        proliferating in meaning as they offered new platforms for
        governmental action. This project tracks the changing set of
        associations around ‘security’ that anticipate the significance
        of the concept during the Cold War and after. To study this, we
        look at Foreign Affairs from the start of its publication (1922)
        to the eve of World War II, measuring the context of the word
        across its use. Crucially, Foreign Affairs prints not only
        academics, but also politicians, policymakers, members of the
        military, and others from across the field of International
        Relations, giving us access to an intersection between theory
        and practice.</p>

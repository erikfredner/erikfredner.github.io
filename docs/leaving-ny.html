Publishing Since 1945</h1>
        <p>Co-authored with <a
        href="https://english.stanford.edu/people/luca-messarra">Luca
        Messarra</a>.</p>
        <p>This project extends <a
        href="https://c19datacollective.com/data/capital-us-literature/">previous
        work on nineteenth century imprints</a> into the twentieth
        century. We reveal two major twentieth-century trends: the rise
        and fall of New York City as the place where most works of
        American literature are published. Since the beginning of the
        twentieth century, New York has usually <em>not</em> published
        most works of American literature. The geographies of US
        literary imprints are more diverse than literary historians
        suspect. Recent US literary histories have been undermined by
        the erroneous assumption that NYC’s qualitative dominance of
        American literature entails its quantitative dominance. This
        data should help the discipline begin to recalibrate this
        bias.</p>
        <p>We argue that this discovery about NYC’s rise and fall in
        post-war American literary history is best explained by major
        changes in printing technology and the business of publishing,
        which nuance conventional narratives of consolidation and
        conglomeration that suggest concentration in NYC. In summary,
        the cost of printing trade-quality books dropped throughout the
        mid-twentieth century due to cost-saving developments in
        printing and typesetting. In conjunction with new
        standardizations in cataloguing, increased small press
        advertising, grant funding by the National Endowment for the
        Arts and others, and the rise of third-party distributors,
        declining costs deregionalized the small press—allowing small
        press publications to circulate nationally, and enabling
        American literary publishing to geographically expand beyond
        NYC.</p>

        <h2 id="what-it-is-like-to-be-alive">“What it is like to be
        alive”</h2>
        <h3 id="description">Description</h3>
        <p>Among many other things, literature tells us about what it is
        like to be alive. Reading the literature of the past can help us
        see that question in a historical sense: “What was it like to be
        alive then?” But it also makes possible another question that
        readers ask themselves as they try to relate to literature
        today: “Is this still what it is like to be alive?”</p>
        <p>This class reflects on these questions by reading epics,
        tragedies, religious texts, narrative poems, and novels about
        people struggling to understand their world and themselves. We
        occasion this practice of reading by thinking about different
        answers to the question of why we should read literature,
        reflecting on what good a practice of reading does for ourselves
        and others. Throughout this course, we will develop an
        understanding of the relationship literature cultivates between
        an individual and their society, and how different literary
        forms attempt to represent the particular and the universal.</p>
        <h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>

        <p>Watching film versions of the dramas can be useful, but is
        not required. If you are going to watch <em>Oedipus</em> on
        film, I recommend the 1967 <em>Oedipus the King</em> starring
        Christopher Plummer. For <em>Macbeth</em>, I recommend the
        recording of the 2010 production starring Patrick Stewart.</p>
        <h2 id="assignments">Assignments</h2>
        <p>Reading is your most important assignment in this course. The
        quality of your reading will be assessed through three written
        responses, which will be as follows:</p>
        <h3 id="assignment-one-structure">Assignment One: Structure</h3>
        <p>750 words. Due by 9 AM on October 1</p>
        <p>Select one aspect of <em>The Odyssey</em> and reflect on how
        it affects the poem’s narrative structure. You may choose any
        aspect of the poem: a character (e.g. Phemius), an object
        (e.g. Odysseus’s bow), a social practice (e.g. ritual
        sacrifice), a poetic device (e.g. Homeric epithets), a place
        (e.g. Troy), an idea (e.g. loyalty to a spouse), a narrative
        device (e.g. “meanwhile”), etc. Your essay must analyze this
        aspect over its full arc within <em>The Odyssey</em>, from
        beginning to end. What impact does it have on the world of the
        poem? How would the narrative be different without it? Because
        this is a short essay, it would be wise to choose a small aspect
        of the text.</p>
        <h2 id="assignment-two-synecdoche">Assignment Two:
        Synecdoche</h2>
        <p>750 words. Due by 9 AM on October 22</p>
        <p>In this assignment, you will be practicing a method of
        literary criticism known as close reading. To do this, we attend
        to a very small section of a work, reading it many times over in
        order to understand not only what it is saying, but how it says
        it. This process often reveals more about not only the passage
        in question, but also the work as a whole.</p>
        <p>Select a passage of no more than 100 words from either
        <em>Oedipus</em> or <em>Genesis</em>. Read it closely. What does
        it say? How does it make you feel? Which linguistic features
        cause those feelings, or advance its ideas? What role does it
        play within the larger work of which it is a part? Is it
        essential to understanding that work? If not, why is it
        there?</p>
        <p>Whatever passage you choose, you must focus most of your
        analysis on specific aspects of the text: its words, their
        etymologies, syntaxes, discourses, etc. Less is, very often,
        more. It would certainly be possible to write your whole essay
        about one well-chosen word.</p>
        <h2 id="assignment-three-synthesis">Assignment Three:
        Synthesis</h2>
        <p>2,000 words. Draft of introduction due Nov. 19. Due
        Dec. 23.</p>
        <p>Your final essay synthesizes the approaches of the first two
        assignments in one longer piece. Here, you will analyze one work
        from this course by paying close attention to a few small pieces
        of it. You will reflect on how the part or parts of the text you
        have chosen represent its world, and the ways in which the
        people who live there relate to the world (or its
        representations). Your analysis might be comparative (e.g. How
        do the older and younger generations understand race in <em>Go
        Tell It on The Mountain</em>?) and/or critical (e.g. Why is this
        particular passage significant for understanding fate in <em>The
        Inferno</em>?) If you wish, you may expand on your ideas, topic,
        or arguments from assignment one or two. This prompt is
        deliberately broad: You may choose a text and topic that are of
        interest to you. We will refine our topics as a class through a
        drafting process.</p>
        <p>To help you produce your best work, we will have three
        writing workshops throughout the semester, one for each paper.
        During each workshop, you will share work in progress with your
        peers. We will ask questions and provide feedback for one
        another. Each of the workshops will run differently depending on
        the requirements of the essay. For example, during the first
        workshop on <em>The</em> <em>Odyssey</em>, students will share
        the aspect of the poem they intend to write about, as well as
        what they have learned about it through their initial reading
        and research.</p>

        <li><p>Plagiarism is “the practice of taking someone else’s work
        or ideas and passing them off as one’s own” (<em>New Oxford
        American Dictionary</em>). It is also a serious form of academic
        dishonesty prohibited under the CUNY policy on academic
        integrity. Failure to quote or cite an external source is a form
        of plagiarism, as is presenting one of your classmates’ ideas as
        your own. Copying text directly from sources is only permissible
        if four criteria are met: first, that the writer attributes the
        source by using both quotation marks and an appropriate
        citation; second, that the source is of a suitable caliber for
        academic use; third, that it is quoted at reasonable length;
        and, fourth, that the citation is used to advance the writer’s
        own argument.</p></li>

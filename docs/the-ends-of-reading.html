    <p><em>This essay is under review.</em></p>
    <p>New analyses of US government survey data reveal that people in
    the US are far less likely to read for pleasure than they were a few
    decades ago. And the decline in reading for pleasure may be
    accelerating among children. This matters for literary studies
    because reading for pleasure is an unacknowledged prerequisite for
    the discipline. For literary studies, the most significant
    implication of the decline in reading for pleasure is that the
    disciplineâ€™s privileged texts and specialized reading practices
    cannot be understood by most people as justifiably privileged or
    specialized because most people do not have recent experiences of
    reading for pleasure against which to compare what and how literary
    studies reads.</p>

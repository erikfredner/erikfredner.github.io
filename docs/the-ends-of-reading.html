    <h1>The Ends of Reading</h1>
        <p>New analyses of US government survey data reveal that people
        in the US are far less likely to read for pleasure than they
        were a few decades ago. And the decline in reading for pleasure
        may be accelerating among children. This matters for literary
        studies because reading for pleasure is an unacknowledged
        prerequisite for the discipline. For literary studies, the most
        significant implication of the decline in reading for pleasure
        is that the disciplineâ€™s privileged texts and specialized
        reading practices cannot be understood by most people as
        justifiably privileged or specialized because most people do not
        have recent experiences of reading for pleasure against which to
        compare what and how literary studies reads.</p>

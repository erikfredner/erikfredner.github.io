        <p><em>Averaging Americans: Why US Literature Started Thinking
        Statistically</em> discovers a significant trend in US literary
        history by computationally analyzing more than 18,000 works of
        US fiction across the long nineteenth century. American authors
        increasingly make generalizations about individuals and groups
        of people using statistical reasoning, and become increasingly
        confident in asserting fixed characteristics as central
        tendencies of groups.</p>
        <p>I argue that this trend reflects an increasing awareness of
        and anxiety about questions of population, polity, and
        representativeness, one that manifests in the attempt to shore
        up qualitative judgments through quantification. Statistical
        reasoning is central to issues of race, class, and power that
        have preoccupied scholars of the US for decades, yet its
        influence on American literature has too rarely been studied.
        This is not because writers of the period were unacquainted with
        the power of statistics to (mis)represent the world; Mark Twain
        famously warned his readers about “three kinds of lies: lies,
        damned lies, and statistics.”</p>

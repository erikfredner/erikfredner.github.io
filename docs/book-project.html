    <p><em>Averaging Americans: Why US Literature Started Thinking
    Statistically</em> discovers a significant trend in US literary
    history by computationally analyzing more than 18,000 works of US
    fiction across the long nineteenth century. American authors
    increasingly make generalizations about individuals and groups of
    people using statistical reasoning, and become increasingly
    confident in asserting fixed characteristics as central tendencies
    of groups.</p>
    <p>I argue that this trend reflects an increasing awareness of and
    anxiety about questions of population, polity, and
    representativeness, one that manifests in the attempt to shore up
    qualitative judgments through quantification. Statistical reasoning
    is central to issues of race, class, and power that have preoccupied
    scholars of the US for decades, yet its influence on American
    literature has too rarely been studied. This is not because writers
    of the period were unacquainted with the power of statistics to
    (mis)represent the world; Mark Twain famously warned his readers
    about “three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies, and statistics.”</p>

        <h2 id="land-acknowledgment">Land Acknowledgment</h2>
        <p>This class at the University of Richmond respectfully
        acknowledges the traditional custodians of the land we are on
        today, the Powhatan people, and pays respect to their elders
        past, present, and emerging.</p>
        <p>To learn more about the land on which the University of
        Richmond exists, I recommend students read the report <a
        href="https://www.richmond.edu/burying-ground/index.html">“Knowledge
        of This Cannot Be Hidden” by Shelby M. Driskill and
        Dr. Lauranett L. Lee</a>, which discusses both the University’s
        geographic connection to the Powhatan people, as well as the
        presence of a burying ground for enslaved laborers on
        campus.</p>
        <h2 id="accessibility">Accessibility</h2>
        <p>I strive to make this course accessible. If you encounter
        barriers to accessibility, please let me know as soon as
        possible.</p>
        <h2 id="course-description">Course Description</h2>
        <p>Topics will include techniques for collecting, organizing,
        analyzing, modeling, and presenting data. Applications to a
        variety of fields will be emphasized. Includes an extensive
        introduction to statistical programming. (See <a
        href="https://catalog.richmond.edu/courses/DSST289">course
        catalog</a>.)</p>
        <h2 id="learning-goals">Learning Goals</h2>
        <p>By the end of this course, students will be able to…</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Collect, manipulate, visualize, and explore data.</li>
        <li>Describe best practices for structuring tabular data.</li>
        <li>Articulate relationships between a data set and analyses
        thereof.</li>
        <li>Use programming language documentation and cookbooks to
        solve problems.</li>
        <li>Understand key aspects of the <a
        href="https://www.r-project.org">R programming language</a> and
        the <a
        href="https://www.tidyverse.org"><code>tidyverse</code></a>.</li>
        <li>Use the <a
        href="https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio/">RStudio</a>
        integrated development environment.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>
        <ul>
        <li>This course neither requires nor expects any prior
        experience with computer programming.</li>
        <li>While we discuss some statistical concepts, students only
        need experience with algebra.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="structure">Structure</h2>
        <p>This course has three units, each of which focuses on an
        aspect of data science:</p>

        <li>Please bring a computer, pencil, and something to write on
        to each class.</li>
        <li>Class materials can be found on the course Blackboard
        site.</li>
        <li>You will submit assignments via Blackboard.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="inclusivity">Inclusivity</h2>
        <p>I expect you to…</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Treat your classmates with respect.</li>
        <li>Support each other in your learning.</li>
        <li>Be patient.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If we spend time reviewing material that you already know,
        remember that it may be the first time some of your peers are
        learning this information. Students come to this class with
        different levels of knowledge. And everyone learns best in
        different ways.</p>
        <h2 id="help">Help</h2>
        <ul>
        <li>We should have a lot of time during class to answer
        questions about course material.
        <ul>
        <li>I will also encourage you to collaborate with peers during
        class time.</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>I encourage you to study with your classmates, though I
        expect all work that you submit to be your own.</li>
        <li>Come to office hours or schedule a meeting for any questions
        or personal concerns that cannot be addressed in class.
        <ul>
        <li>To schedule, email me with your availability at least one
        day before you’d like to meet.</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>Note that I generally do not answer conceptual questions
        about homework before they are due.
        <ul>
        <li>Homework is graded on timely completion and effort,
        <em>not</em> accuracy.</li>

        <p>Late assignments are penalized one letter grade (i.e., -10
        points) per day.</p>
        <h3 id="homework">Homework</h3>
        <p>Most class meetings will have a reading posted on our
        website. A few questions are included at the end of each
        reading. These must be completed before class. Please bring the
        written responses with you to class. You will upload completed
        questions to the course website.</p>
        <p>You will be given an opportunity to begin working on homework
        during class. Your homework grade will be based on the
        proportion of assignments that you complete on time. If you put
        in a good-faith effort on the homework, it will be marked
        complete.</p>
        <h3 id="participation">Participation</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>After a brief lecture reviewing material from the reading,
        you will work on practice notebooks during class in small
        groups.</li>
        <li>Everyone may have up to two unexcused absences.
        <ul>
        <li>Additional unexcused absences will harm your participation
        grade.</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>You may email me to request an excused absence.
        <ul>
        <li>Your request will be approved if it is for illness,
        hospitalization, death in the family, important religious
        holidays, or university activities (e.g., field trips,
        University-sponsored athletic events).</li>
        <li>You do <em>not</em> need to provide details if request an
        absence for one of the reasons above.
        <ul>
        <li>Simply say, “I’m sick.” You don’t need to tell me, e.g., “I
        have strep throat.”</li>
        </ul></li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>Students who receive excused absences may submit homework
        late.</li>
        <li>Please request an excused absence before missing class if
        possible.
        <ul>
        <li>If you request an excused absence <em>after</em> missing
        class, you must do so as soon as possible.</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>If you cannot attend a scheduled exam or the final project
        presentation, please let me know as far in advance as
        possible.</li>

        <p>Each of the three exams has two halves: a take-home open-book
        part and an in-class closed-book part.</p>
        <p>The take-home will be distributed in advance of the in-class
        exam. Answers to the take-home should be submitted by the
        beginning of the in-class exam. A list of topics for the
        in-class exam will be posted on the course website.</p>
        <h3 id="final-project">Final Project</h3>
        <p>The final project will be due during the last week of class.
        The project will ask you to find or create a new data set, and
        apply techniques learned throughout the class to analyze it. The
        project will take the form of a digital poster session and a
        one-page reflection. Detailed instructions will be provided
        later in the course.</p>
        <h2 id="honor">Honor</h2>
        <p>This course is taught in accordance with the University of
        Richmond Honor Code, which can be accessed via <a
        href="https://studentdevelopment.richmond.edu/student-handbook/honor/">The
        Honor Councils website</a>. You are encouraged to collaborate on
        homework, but each student must contribute work to the group. On
        exams, cheating includes, but is not limited to, viewing
        another’s work with or without their consent, or duplicating any
        portion of it. If you are found to have violated the Honor Code,
        you fail this course. If you ever have any questions about

        <h3 id="generative-artificial-intelligence">Generative
        Artificial Intelligence</h3>
        <p>Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) programs,
        especially large language models (LLMs), can be useful tools for
        coding. However, over reliance on LLMs or other resources where
        you can copy answers to programming problems directly (e.g.,
        StackOverflow) will impede your learning.</p>
        <p>Moreover, LLMs sometimes answer questions incorrectly and/or
        using different methodologies than those we study in class. When
        LLMs make stuff up (e.g., libraries that don’t exist), this is
        referred to as <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallucination_(artificial_intelligence)">“hallucination.”</a>
        In order to be an effective user of these technologies, it is
        crucial for you to recognize when that happens and how to
        respond.</p>
        <h3 id="prohibited-uses-of-genai">Prohibited uses of GenAI</h3>
        <ol type="1">
        <li>Submitting any model output, in part or in whole, as your
        own work. This includes code and writing.</li>
        <li>Uploading any data used in this course (e.g.,
        <code>.csv</code> files) to multimodal GenAI tools like
        ChatGPT.</li>
        <li>Using GenAI tools on the take-home portion of exams.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Any of the above uses would be treated as violations of the
        honor code.</p>

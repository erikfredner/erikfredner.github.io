    <h1>Literary Studies According to <i>The MLA International
Bibliography</i></h1>
        <p>Co-authored with <a
        href="https://english.stanford.edu/people/mark-algee-hewitt">Mark
        Algee-Hewitt</a>.</p>
        <p>Over several years, Mark Algee-Hewitt and I negotiated the
        first-ever release of approximately 1 million bibliographic
        records from <em>The Modern Language Association’s International
        Bibliography</em> (<em>MLAIB</em>), which describe scholarly
        monographs, edited volumes, and journal articles about
        literatures in English. This English-language literature subset
        represents about 1/3 of the <em>MLAIB</em>’s total records. A
        few articles have used small samples and derivative data from
        the <em>MLAIB</em> before, but this will be the first-ever
        analysis of a comprehensive set of complete bibliographic
        metadata.</p>
        <p>These records not only contain metadata about the articles
        themselves (author, press, journal, etc.), but also contain
        metadata about their contents as described by bibliographers
        (subject authors, subject works, genres, critical methodologies,
        etc.) using the controlled vocabularies of <em>The MLA
        Thesaurus</em> and the Contextual Indexing and Faceted Taxonomic
        Access System (CIFT) designed to support the early digitization
        of the <em>MLAIB</em>.</p>
        <p>The article describes large-scale trends in the recent
        history of English-language literary studies, with a special
        emphasis on the changing composition of the canon within English
        literary studies from 1982 to present.</p>

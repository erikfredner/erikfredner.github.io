    <h1 class="page-title">Literary Studies According to The MLA
International Bibliography</h1>
    <p>Over several years, Mark Algee-Hewitt and I negotiated the
    first-ever release of approximately 1 million bibliographic records
    from <em>The Modern Language Association’s International
    Bibliography</em> (<em>MLAIB</em>), which describe scholarly
    monographs, edited volumes, and journal articles about literatures
    in English. This English-language literature subset represents about
    1/3 of the <em>MLAIB</em>’s total records.</p>
    <p>These records not only contain metadata about the articles
    themselves (author, press, journal, etc.), but also contain metadata
    about their contents as described by bibliographers (subject
    authors, subject works, genres, critical methodologies, etc.) using
    the controlled vocabularies of <em>The MLA Thesaurus</em> and the
    Contextual Indexing and Faceted Taxonomic Access System (CIFT)
    designed to support the early digitization of the
    <em>MLAIB</em>.</p>
    <p>A few articles have used small samples and derivative data from
    the <em>MLAIB</em> before, but this will be the first-ever analysis
    of a comprehensive set of complete bibliographic metadata.</p>
    <p>The article will describe large-scale trends in the recent
    history of English-language literary studies, with a special
    emphasis on the history of literary studies from 1982 to present,
    which is when the <em>MLAIB</em> implemented its computationally
    controlled vocabularies for bibliographers.</p>

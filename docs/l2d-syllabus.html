        <p>This class at the University of Virginia respectfully
        acknowledges the custodians of the land we are on today, the
        Monacan Nation, and pay our respect to their elders past,
        present and emerging. To learn more about UVA’s past and present
        connections to the Monacan Nation, I recommend <a
        href="https://eocr.virginia.edu/monacan">this website</a> from
        the Office for Equal Opportunity and Civil Rights. To learn more
        about the Monacan people, <a

        and Scientific Engagement” description</h2>
        <p>This course, one of four “Engagements” courses you’ll take as
        a first-year student, focuses on what we can learn from
        examining the ways in which facts and evidence are identified,
        collected, analyzed, and interpreted. Both within and beyond the
        university, you will encounter claims about the natural and
        social worlds and be confronted with situations that require you
        to evaluate and make decisions based on evidence. Empirical
        methods are a crucial component to addressing and answering such
        a broad range of essential questions. We will explore how
        questions and hypotheses are formulated and evaluated.</p>
        <h2 id="from-language-to-data-description">“From Language to
        Data” description</h2>
        <p>Targeted advertisements make people think that their phones
        are listening to them. Getting an ad for something you were just
        talking or thinking about feels uncanny. But your phone does not
        need to listen to you to effectively target you. Targeted
        advertising fuels the internet. And the successful
        transformation of language into data fuels targeted
        advertising.</p>
        <p>In this course, we study how and why people transform
        language into data. What do we gain? What do we lose? We
        consider several types of texts—including speech, digital
        communications, and published texts—and many ways they get
        turned into data.</p>
        <p>This course not only engages questions from academic fields
        like digital humanities and computational linguistics, but also
        practical questions of everyday life in the twenty-first
        century, from communicating with our friends to researching new
        topics.</p>
        <h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>
        <p>By the end of this course, students will be able to…</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p>Identify and articulate insights from challenging
        readings</p></li>
        <li><p>Describe empirical evidence that can be derived from
        English-language texts</p></li>
        <li><p>Articulate strengths and weaknesses of empirical
        approaches to language</p></li>
        <li><p>Evaluate what we can know with respect to the digital
        cultural record</p></li>

        <p>If you are sick and need to miss class, email me. Students
        who miss class due to illness will receive excused absences and
        alternative assignments.</p>
        <h2 id="grading">Grading</h2>
        <p>This class uses contract grading. Contract grading aspires to
        be more transparent and equitable than traditional grading. It
        should motivate you to focus on the course material instead of
        worrying about whether you have a 92.4% or a 92.6%.</p>
        <p>Here is how it works. You will tell me what grade you intend
        to earn. Then, you will sign a contract stating that you will
        satisfactorily complete a specific amount of work that will earn
        you that grade. You can contract for an A, B, or C. If you do
        not satisfactorily complete enough work to fulfill the terms of
        your contract, you may still receive a D or F.</p>
        <p>Read the contract for a full explanation.</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p>If you have obligations that require you to miss specific
        classes (e.g. away games), please let me know about them as far
        in advance as possible.</p></li>
        <li><p>Students requesting an extension due to
        <em>foreseeable</em> circumstances must email me 48 hours prior
        to the deadline.</p>
        <ul>
        <li>For example, food poisoning is not foreseeable. A midterm
        for another class is foreseeable.</li>
        </ul></li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="email">Email</h2>
        <p>I reply to emails within two business days. If it has been
        more than two business days, please write me again.</p>

        <p>I will schedule office hours in person or virtually at a

        <h2 id="engagements-experience">Engagements Experience</h2>
        <p>As a student at the University of Virginia, you are part of
        an exciting and robust intellectual community. The goal of the
        Engagement Experience (EE) is to make you feel welcomed into
        this community, where you’ll discover new ideas and meet
        fascinating people. The EE is part of the Engagements program,
        existing alongside the Engagement course you are currently
        taking.</p>
        <p>The EE must be satisfactorily completed for <em>every</em>
        contract. There are three components this spring:</p>
        <ol type="1">
        <li><p>Attend the Spring '23 Engagements
        Experience Lecture</p></li>
        <li><p>Complete an Academic Advising Activity</p></li>
        <li><p>Complete an Engaging Grounds experience</p></li>
        </ol>
        <h3 id="component-1-engagements-experience-lecture">Component 1:
        Engagements Experience Lecture</h3>
        <p>Attend—either virtually, or in person—ONE Engagements lecture
        each quarter. This spring, the second event is Eze Amos’ talk
        about the series of photographs he took on August 11-12, 2017 of
        the Unite the Right and counter-protests. <strong>The talk will
        be held on April 11<sup>th</sup> at 7 pm in the Paramount
        Theater in downtown Charlottesville.</strong> For those of you
        who are unable to attend in person, the talk will be recorded
        and you must watch that recording.</p>
        <p>If you attend in person, you MUST plan to stay the entire
        time. This is a chance to practice scholarly expectations, which
        include hearing all of a talk and the Q&amp;A.</p>
        <h3 id="component-2-academic-advising-activity">Component 2:
        Academic Advising Activity</h3>
        <p>As you approach the culmination of your first year at UVA,
        you will have made significant progress towards the completion
        of the Engagements Pathway requirements. You will have taken a
        course in each Engagements pillar and made headway into
        completing your Literacy and Disciplines Requirements. The EE
        will help keep you on track by asking you to complete one
        academic advising activity during each quarter. These activities
        will help prepare you for coursework in the following
        semester.</p>
        <p>Meet with your academic advisor</p>
        <p>In advance of registering for classes for the Fall 2023
        semester, you must attend your scheduled faculty advising
        meeting. <strong>If you have not received a message from your
        advisor about scheduling these meetings by March
        27<sup>th</sup>, reach out to them to schedule
        something.</strong></p>
        <h3 id="component-3-engaging-grounds">Component 3: Engaging
        Grounds</h3>
        <p>Each quarter you will participate in one Engaging
        Grounds experience. You may choose which experience to complete
        from the curated list of Engaging Grounds experiences below.
        Note that many options may be completed at your convenience, but
        Scholar Speaks (on-Grounds lectures or presentations) have a set
        date and time. See the <a
        href="https://gened.as.virginia.edu/engagements-experience">calendar</a>
        on the Engagements Experience website for Scholar Speak
        Opportunities.</p>
        <p>The list will be updated regularly throughout the semester.
        While you have many options for completing this requirement,
        don't wait until the last second as these opportunities are
        finite.</p>
        <p>Engaging Grounds</p>
        <p>The College Fellows have curated the following list
        of Engaging Grounds experiences as a representation of the
        myriad of wonderful opportunities you have as students at UVA.
        While we hope that you will participate in each before
        graduation, you should select and complete one for each
        Engagements quarter.</p>

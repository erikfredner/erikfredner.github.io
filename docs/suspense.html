        <p>With Mark Algee-Hewitt, Chelsea Davis, Abigail Droge, Tasha
        Eccles, Morgan Frank, J. D. Porter, Andrew Shephard, Hannah
        Walser</p>
        <p>This project seeks to bridge the gap between the experience
        of suspense as it is felt by the reader in anticipation of
        impending events, and the formal features that may be
        responsible for producing this feeling. Does suspense work in
        the same way in every period and genre, and for all types of
        readers – or is it a highly individual reaction, promoted by
        techniques that vary according to time and place? The diverse
        group of researchers involved in this project are exploring
        these central questions – which lie at the intersection of
        language, narrative and psychology – via a detailed comparative
        analysis of “suspenseful” texts from 1750 to the present
        day.</p>

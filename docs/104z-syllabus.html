        <h3 id="course-policies">Course Policies</h3>
        <h4 id="discussion-participation">Discussion Participation</h4>
        <p>Students are expected to participate in all graded
        discussions. While there is great flexibility in online courses,
        this is not a self-paced course. You will need to participate in
        discussions on at least two different days most weeks, with your
        first post due no later than Wednesday evening.</p>
        <h4 id="late-work-policy">Late Work Policy</h4>
        <ul>
        <li>Late assignments will be accepted with a late penalty of
        -10% per day.</li>
        <li>Late work may not receive instructor feedback.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="extensions">Extensions</h4>
        <ul>
        <li>Email me as soon as possible to request an extension.
        <ul>
        <li>For example, if a deadline in this course conflicts with
        your assigned jury duty dates, I would happily grant you an
        extension.</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>Extension requests made within 48 hours of a deadline for
        foreseeable reasons will likely be rejected.
        <ul>
        <li>For example, if a deadline in this class conflicts with a
        deadline in another one of your courses, that is a foreseeable
        reason because both deadlines were available on the
        syllabi.</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>Extension requests made within 48 hours for unforeseeable
        reasons will likely be granted.
        <ul>
        <li>For example, if you get sick, that would not be
        foreseeable.</li>
        </ul></li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="incompletes">Incompletes</h4>
        <p>When a requirement of a course has not been completed for
        reasons acceptable to the instructor and the rest of the
        academic work is passing, a report of “I” (incomplete) may be
        made and additional time granted, according to <a
        href="https://catalog.oregonstate.edu/regulations/">Academic
        Regulation 17 of OSU Academic Regulations</a>.</p>
        <p>If you are having any difficulty that might prevent you
        completing the coursework, please don’t wait until the end of
        the term; let me know right away.</p>
        <h4 id="statement-regarding-religious-accommodation">Statement
        Regarding Religious Accommodation</h4>
        <p>Oregon State University is required to provide reasonable
        accommodations for employee and student sincerely held religious
        beliefs. It is incumbent on the student making the request to
        make the faculty member aware of the request as soon as possible
        prior to the need for the accommodation. See the <a
        href="https://eoa.oregonstate.edu/accommodations/religion">Religious
        Accommodation Process for Students</a>.</p>
        <h4 id="class-participation-and-building-community">Class
        Participation and Building Community</h4>
        <p>Active interaction with peers and your instructor is
        essential to everyone’s success in this online course. I
        encourage you to please practice the following:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Value the diversity of the class. Recognize and respect the
        experiences, abilities, and knowledge each person brings to our
        learning environment.</li>
        <li>Challenge others’ ideas with the intent of facilitating
        growth. Acknowledge your peers’ contributions and highlight
        areas of further inquiry.</li>
        <li>Be open to being challenged on your ideas or
        prejudices.</li>
        <li>Practice self-awareness in your communication with peers and
        consider that your comments may hurt others
        unintentionally.</li>
        <li>Assume the best of your classmates and instructor and expect
        the best from them.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="content-warning">Content Warning</h4>
        <p>Literature often deals with difficult topics, including (but
        not limited to) mental illness, violence, racism, sexual
        assault, war, trauma, and death. We will discuss those topics as
        they arise in our reading. Please consider whether you are
        comfortable reading and writing about those topics this term.
        There won’t be individual content warnings on each story.</p>
        <p>As a member of this classroom community, please be thoughtful
        and respectful about how you write about difficult topics.
        Remember that a fictional scene for you might be lived
        experience for someone else, and it can be difficult to know how
        our words impact others. Please use compassion and common sense
        when speaking about these issues in discussion boards.</p>
        <p>If you find one of our stories this term too difficult to
        read or discuss, you can contact me for alternative assignments
        for the quiz and discussion board that week.</p>
        <h4 id="academic-integrity">Academic Integrity</h4>
        <p>It is important that you understand what student actions are
        defined as academic misconduct at Oregon State University. Refer
        to the <a href="https://scs.oregonstate.edu/">OSU Student Code
        of Conduct</a> and the <a
        href="https://studentlife.oregonstate.edu/">Office of the Dean
        of Students</a> for more information. More importantly, if you
        are unsure if something will violate our academic integrity
        policy, ask your professors, GTAs, academic advisors, or
        academic integrity officers.</p>
        <p>Academic misconduct, or violations of academic integrity, can
        fall into seven broad areas, including but not limited to:
        cheating; plagiarism; falsification; assisting; tampering;
        multiple submissions of work; and unauthorized recording and
        use.</p>
        <h5 id="generative-artificial-intelligence">Generative
        Artificial Intelligence</h5>
        <p>Student use of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI)
        does not typically advance the learning goals in this course,
        which focus on developing the core activities of reading,
        thinking, and writing.</p>
        <p>As a result, the use of any GenAI tools (including but not
        limited to ChatGPT, Copilot, or Claude) to generate or edit any
        portion of the substance of your work is not permitted unless
        explicitly noted in the assignment instructions. While this
        course recognizes that AI is increasingly embedded in everyday
        tools like <a
        href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/word/word-ai">Microsoft
        Word</a> and <a
        href="https://search.google/ai-in-search/">Google Search</a>,
        you are not allowed to use AI for your coursework beyond these
        limited non-substantive supports.</p>
        <h6 id="acceptable-genai-use">Acceptable GenAI Use</h6>
        <p>I allow one general use of GenAI because it advances the
        learning goals of this course.</p>
        <p>Everyone encounters words, sentences, and paragraphs in
        literary texts that they do not understand. Often, this
        difficulty is inherent in the text because literature attempts
        to express subtle or uncommon experiences. In literature
        classes, we learn how to overcome such difficulties by facing
        them again and again. Usually, these cases require careful
        reading and thinking in order to arrive at an interpretation of
        what a text might mean. This kind of difficulty would not
        benefit from the use of GenAI because the “answer” that GenAI
        would provide would almost certainly differ from the
        interpretation you would arrive at on your own. Everyone needs
        to practice interpreting texts in order to distinguish between
        better and worse interpretations.</p>
        <p>Other times, students face barriers to comprehension above
        and beyond what a text’s imagined reader might face. This could
        the use of vocabulary or phrases that they do not know, or
        references to unknown people, places, or events. In such cases,
        students may use GenAI to aid their <em>comprehension</em>. By
        “comprehension,” I mean that you get to the end of a sentence or
        paragraph, and think to yourself, “I don’t understand this at
        all.”</p>
        <p>When facing a sentence or paragraph that you struggle to
        comprehend in this way, I ask you to do these things in this
        order. You may stop at any point once you have figured it
        out.</p>
        <ol type="1">
        <li>Read it twice.</li>
        <li>Look up unfamiliar words or phrases.</li>
        <li>Re-read it after looking up words or phrases that you do not
        know.</li>
        <li>If you are still struggling, transcribe the passage, then
        ask this class’s Custom GPT for help:</li>
        </ol>
        <p><a
        href="https://chatgpt.com/g/g-694188684cd481918fcf8f700673cd02-introduction-to-fiction-tutor"><strong>Custom
        GPT</strong></a></p>
        <p>The Custom GPT expects to receive a sentence, paragraph, or
        passage from a work of fiction, and has been instructed to help
        you comprehend the passage. I ask that you use this Custom GPT
        because its behavior should be limited in ways that benefit the
        learning objectives of this course rather than impeding
        them.</p>
        <h5 id="turnitin">Turnitin</h5>
        <p>Your instructor may ask you to submit one or more of your
        writings to Turnitin, a plagiarism prevention service. Your
        assignment content will be checked for potential plagiarism
        against Internet sources, academic journal articles, and the
        papers of other OSU students, for common or borrowed content.
        Turnitin generates a report that highlights any potentially
        unoriginal text in your paper. The report may be submitted
        directly to your instructor or your instructor may elect to have
        you submit initial drafts through Turnitin, and you will receive
        the report allowing you the opportunity to make adjustments and
        ensure that all source material has been properly cited. Papers
        you submit through Turnitin for this or any class will be added
        to the OSU Turnitin database and may be checked against other
        OSU paper submissions. You will retain all rights to your
        written work.</p>

        Responses are anonymous (unless a student chooses to “sign”
        their comments, agreeing to relinquish anonymity of written
        comments) and are not available to instructors until after
        grades have been posted. The results of scaled questions and
        signed comments go to both the instructor and their unit
        head/supervisor. Anonymous (unsigned) comments go to the
        instructor only.</p>

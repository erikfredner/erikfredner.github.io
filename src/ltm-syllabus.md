title: Literary Text Mining
toc: true

## Description

Computational methods have made it possible to analyze literature in new ways and at new scales. This course trains students in theories and methods of computational literary studies. It requires no background in computer programming or literary criticism. We begin with fundamentals of the Python programming language before moving on to computational analyses of literary texts. Our analyses will be informed by critical readings. While programming distinguishes this course from many other humanities classes, this course is fundamentally about literature, and what we can learn about it at the new scales afforded by computation.

## Objectives

Students will be able to:

* Plan and justify a program of computational literary analysis.
* Create a corpus and metadata to study a research question.
* Use all basic elements of Python proficiently.
* Use several data science and text mining packages.
* Visualize data.
* Integrate data analysis into literary criticism.

## Technology

All students will need a laptop running macOS, Linux, or Windows that they can bring to class. (MacOS is preferred.) Chromebooks and iPads will not work for this course. If you need access to an appropriate laptop, please let me know ASAP.

## Readings

All readings for this course will be posted on Canvas. Please note that many readings will be excerpted. If you need paper copies, please let me know ASAP.

## Calendar

I give abbreviated titles for some readings in the calendar. Full citations are available in the bibliography at the end of the syllabus.

## Literary Lab meetings

Students are encouraged to attend meetings of the Stanford Literary Lab, a research group that focuses on computational text analysis: <https://litlab.stanford.edu/>

## Grading

I round grades to the nearest integer.

Letter | Range
|---|---|
A | 93 or more
A- | 90-92
B+ | 87-89
B | 83-86
B- | 80-82
C+ | 77-79
C | 73-76
C- | 70-72
D+ | 67-69
D | 60-66
F | 59 or less

## Evaluation

Item | Percentage | Description
|-----|---|-------------|
Homework | 40% | Weekly assignments that apply material from class.
Participation | 20% | Attendance, discussion, and lab work.
Presentation | 10% | One in-class presentation of original research.
Final Essay | 30% | Uses evidence from computational analysis to advance a literary critical argument.

Homework will include programming practice, new problems, and written reflections on readings or results.

Attendance is crucial in this course since computational methods build on each other. If you must miss a class, I expect you to cover the material you missed during office hours, or with classmates.

Further details on the presentation and final essay will be circulated later in the quarter.

## Miscellaneous Items

### Accommodations

* Please let me know about any accommodations you require ASAP.
* Contact the Office of Accessible Education if you need an updated letter.

### Absences

* Students are allowed one unexcused absence.
* Email me at least 24 hours prior to class to secure an excused absence.
* If you know you will be absent on specific days this quarter (e.g. away games), please let me know as far in advance as possible.

### Email

* I usually reply to email within a day. If you have not heard from me after that time, please write again.

### Office hours

* If you cannot make my regular office hours, I would be happy to schedule a meeting at another time that works for both of us.
* To discuss writing in progress, I ask that you send me your text two days before we meet.

### Late work

* I apply a -10% penalty for each day that passes after the original deadline to late work.
* I do not accept work that is more than four days late.
* (Yes, weekends count.)

### Other

* Take advantage of the Hume Center for Writing and Speaking while drafting and revising your final essay.
* If you get stuck on a programming problem, I encourage you to reach out to your classmates to solve it together.
* Mental and physical health are essential for you to do your best work. If you are feeling unwell at any point during the quarter, please talk to me.

## Appendix

### Honor Code

The Honor Code is an undertaking of the students, individually and collectively:

a. that they will not give or receive aid in examinations; that they will not give or receive unpermitted aid in class work, in the preparation of reports, or in any other work that is to be used by the instructor as the basis of grading;

b. that they will do their share and take an active part in seeing to it that others as well as themselves uphold the spirit and letter of the Honor Code.

The faculty on its part manifests its confidence in the honor of its students by refraining from proctoring examinations and from taking unusual and unreasonable precautions to prevent the forms of dishonesty mentioned above. The faculty will also avoid, as far as practicable, academic procedures that create temptations to violate the Honor Code.

While the faculty alone has the right and obligation to set academic requirements, the students and faculty will work together to establish optimal conditions for honorable academic work.

#### Fundamental Standard

Students are expected to show both within and without the University such respect for order, morality, personal honor, and the rights of others as is demanded of good citizens. Failure to do this will be sufficient cause for removal from the University.

### Students with Documented Disabilities

Students who may need an academic accommodation based on the impact of a disability must initiate the request with the Office of Accessible Education (OAE). Professional staff will evaluate the request with required documentation, recommend reasonable accommodations, and prepare an Accommodation Letter for faculty dated in the current quarter in which the request is being made. Students should contact the OAE as soon as possible since timely notice is needed to coordinate accommodations.

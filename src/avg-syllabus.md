## "Averaging Americans"

### Description

Perennially invoked by politicians and pundits, declared "divine" by
Walt Whitman, the "average American" has been one of the United States'
most important fictional characters for well over a century. But do
averages tell us anything about the individuals from whom they are
derived? And who benefits when we use the "average American" as a way of
saying who represents the U.S.? The logic of the average resonates with
American self-concepts of democracy, equality, and scientific
rationalism, yet the same data can be used to suppress difference and
dissent. How does the novel propagate and problematize this idea of the
representative individual? In this class, we explore these tensions
between the individual and the social by reading two novels---Sinclair
Lewis's *Babbitt* and Richard Wright's *Native Son*---in conversation
with two literary critical approaches: Marxist literary theory and the
digital humanities methods associated with Stanford's Literary Lab. The
course includes an introduction to the programming language R for text
analysis. As we move between close and distant scales of reading, we
will ask how numbers and texts attempt to represent American personhood.
(No prior experience with statistics, programming, Marxist theory, or
the digital humanities is required.)

### Goals

Students will be able to:

- Develop a research project through a process of presentation, revision, and writing.
- Describe distant reading and apply several of its conceptual and methodological interventions to their own research.
- Describe historical, social, and aesthetic concepts associated with Marxist thought.
- Apply central ideas and methods of Marxist thought to literary critical work.
- Consider intersections of class and race in American literary history.
- Discuss the relay between power and the statistical imagination.

### Assignments

Collaboration is a distinctive feature of digital humanities research.
In that spirit, students will present their work in class **before and
after** each assignment comes due. During the first meeting (referred to
as a "lab"), students share their initial ideas, arguments, and
evidence, then receive questions and feedback from the group. This is as
much about the quality of the ideas you bring to the room as it is your
ability to help others develop their own. During the second meeting
(referred to as a "presentation"), students present their work in a more
formal setting. We discuss matters relating to evidence, argumentation,
and writing.

This structure mimics the work of the Literary Lab, where lab members
develop, present, and discuss their work with collaborators and guests,
often presenting the same project many times as it develops.

> **[Assignment one:]{.smallcaps}** Select an excerpt from *Babbitt* and
> explore its relation to one of the themes the novel engages (700
> words, not including the text of the excerpt). Then, reflect on the
> representativeness of the passage in relation to the novel or theme.
> Describe the concept of representativeness used in the analysis (300
> words).
>
> **[Assignment two:]{.smallcaps}** Select any concept within the realm
> of this course. Then, explicate it by (1) describing its ideal type
> and (2) identifying a manifestation of the concept in either novel on
> the syllabus, noting the ways in which its appearance accords with or
> breaks from its ideal type (700 words).\
> Then, students will discuss whether their concept could be
> operationalized, and, if so, venture how it might be done (300 words).
> Assignment two may be revised and integrated into the final paper.
>
> **[Assignment three:]{.smallcaps}** Students will make use of a
> concept from this class (preferably but not necessarily the one from
> assignment two) in order to study a novel and/or a corpus of novels
> from the postbellum period in a research paper. Students will read
> distantly using a corpus of American fiction in order to provide at
> least one piece of evidence for their argument.\
> The distant reading component of this paper can be major or minor. A
> paper with a major distant reading component might operationalize a
> concept and analyze the results of the experiment. A paper with a
> minor distant reading component might use one graph as evidence in
> their argument (4,000 words). Neither is favored over the other.\
> If a student's project requires a more complex study than the time of
> the quarter allows, students can supplement the distant reading
> component of the final paper with a study design proposal. (1,000
> additional words, including question, hypothesis, description of
> corpus and method, and the relationship between the question and the
> argument of the final paper.)
>
> **[At some point during the quarter:]{.smallcaps}** Students attend
> one meeting of the Literary Lab. Students will be provided with the
> schedule of events near the start of the quarter. (If a student's
> academic schedule prevents them from attending, accommodations will be
> made.)

If you want to discuss work in progress, send me your text at least

## Other Information & Resources

**WISE**

Although each WISE (Writing Intensive Seminar in English) is unique, all
WISE classes share fundamental learning goals that fulfill both the WIM
(Writing in the Major) requirement for English majors and the
university's Aesthetic and Interpretive Inquiry (AII) Way. In all WISE
classes, students will explore and analyze literary texts (and in some
cases other cultural objects), along with critical or theoretical pieces
selected to support students' investigations of primary readings and to
offer models of inquiry and writing in the field of literary study.
Students will also advance their own analytical, research, and writing
skills through a structured series of assignments that includes: at
least one assignment developing close reading skills; at least one
assignment engaging critical or theoretical writings; and a final essay,
developed in stages, that investigates primary texts, and that draws in
relevant critical or historical sources, to produce a synthesized,
original argument.

**Honor Code**

The Honor Code is the university\'s statement on academic integrity,
written by students in 1921. It articulates university expectations of
students and faculty in establishing and maintaining the highest
standards in academic work. The Honor Code is an undertaking of the
students, individually and collectively:

1) that they will not give or receive aid in examinations; that they
    will not give or receive unpermitted aid in class work, in the
    preparation of reports, or in any other work that is to be used by
    the instructor as the basis of grading;

2) that they will do their share and take an active part in seeing to
    it that others as well as themselves uphold the spirit and letter of
    the Honor Code.

3) The faculty on its part manifests its confidence in the honor of its
    students by refraining from proctoring examinations and from taking
    unusual and unreasonable precautions to prevent the forms of
    dishonesty mentioned above. The faculty will also avoid, as far as
    practicable, academic procedures that create temptations to violate
    the Honor Code.

4) While the faculty alone has the right and obligation to set academic
    requirements, the students and faculty will work together to
    establish optimal conditions for honorable academic work.

The fundamental standard is also a key part of fostering a discussion
environment built on trust and creativity:

1) Students are expected to respect and uphold the rights and dignity
    of others regardless of race, color, national or ethnic origin, sex,
    age, disability, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, or
    socio-economic status.

2) Students are expected to uphold the integrity of the university as a
    community of scholars in which free speech is available to all and
    intellectual honesty is demanded of all.

**Students with Documented Disabilities**

Students who may need an academic accommodation based on the impact of a
disability must initiate the request with the Office of Accessible
Education (OAE). Professional staff will evaluate the request with
required documentation, recommend reasonable accommodations, and prepare
an Accommodation Letter for faculty dated in the current quarter in
which the request is being made. Students should contact the OAE as soon
as possible since timely notice is needed to coordinate accommodations.
OAE can be reached at 563 Salvatierra Walk; 650-723-1066; and/or

## Land Acknowledgment

This class at the University of Richmond respectfully acknowledges the traditional custodians of the land we are on today, the Powhatan people, and pays respect to their elders past, present, and emerging.

To learn more about the land on which the University of Richmond exists, I recommend students read the report ["Knowledge of This Cannot Be Hidden" by Shelby M. Driskill and Dr. Lauranett L. Lee](https://www.richmond.edu/burying-ground/index.html), which discusses both the University's geographic connection to the Powhatan people, as well as the presence of a burying ground for enslaved laborers on campus.

## Accessibility

I strive to make this course accessible. If you encounter barriers to accessibility, please let me know as soon as possible.

## Description

This course introduces advanced approaches to the analysis of data. It emphasizes what Hadley Wickham calls the ["whole game"](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/whole-game) of data science: creating, importing, tidying, transforming, visualizing, and communicating about data. We will focus on data about and derived from texts in this class.

See the [course catalog](https://datascience.richmond.edu/academics/courses.html).

## Learning Goals

By the end of this course, students will be able to...

- Collect, manipulate, tidy, visualize, and explore data using basic and advanced techniques.
- Identify specific challenges and opportunities of working with data derived from texts.
- Understand key aspects of the [R programming language](https://www.r-project.org) and the [`tidyverse`](https://www.tidyverse.org).
- Use the [RStudio](https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio/) integrated development environment.
- Use [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) to create high-quality research documents and websites.
- Use programming language documentation, cookbooks, and large language models to solve programming problems.

## Materials

- Class materials will be posted on Blackboard throughout the semester.
- Please bring a computer, pencil, and paper to each class.

## Inclusivity

I expect you to...

- Treat your classmates with respect.
- Be patient.
- Support each other in your learning.

## Help

- I reserve class time to answer questions and help with problem sets.
- I encourage you to work on problem sets and study with your classmates during and outside of class.
- Come to office hours.

- I round fractional grades.
- I reserve the right to curve grades.

### Participation

- Participation includes preparation, attendance, and effective use of class time.
- Everyone gets three unexcused absences.
  - Additional unexcused absences will harm your participation grade.
- Email me before the class you will miss to request an excused absence.

### Code Interview

Near the end of the semester, you will complete a code interview. I will ask you to explain your approach and solutions to a few randomly selected problems from the notebooks assigned throughout the semester.

If you do not complete the notebooks, you cannot succeed on the code interview.

### Group Projects

- Groups of two to three students will be randomly assigned for each project.
- In addition to submitting the project, group members will complete self and peer evaluations.
- Generally, groups with mutually positive peer evaluations will share a grade.
  - If a group member receives a negative peer evaluation, they may receive a lower grade than the rest of the group.
- I want groups to share work **equitably**.

### Final Project

Unlike earlier projects in the semester, final projects are individual. Your final project will result in a **formal** report including original code, data visualizations, explanatory and interpretive writing, and proper citations.

### Late work

- Late work is penalized one letter grade (i.e., -10 points) per day.
- If you need an extension on an assignment, it never hurts to ask!
  - I will be much more likely to grant extensions requested well in advance.
  - If you request an extension within 24 hours of a deadline, it will not be approved except in exceptional circumstances.

## Honor

This course is taught in accordance with the University of Richmond Honor Code, which can be accessed via [The Honor Councils website](https://studentdevelopment.richmond.edu/student-handbook/honor/).

If you are found to have violated the Honor Code, you will fail this course.

If you ever have any questions about whether an action would be an honor violation, re-read the syllabus. If it is still unclear, please ask me.

### Generative Artificial Intelligence

Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) programs, especially large language models (LLMs), are useful tools for coding. However, overreliance on GenAI impedes learning.

Moreover, LLMs often answer questions incorrectly or incompletely. In order to be an effective user of these technologies, it is crucial for you to be able to recognize when that happens, and how to respond.

### Prohibited Uses of GenAI

- Submitting model output, in part or in whole, as if it were your original work. This includes code or writing.
- Uploading any data used in this course (e.g., `.csv` files) to multimodal GenAI tools like ChatGPT.

### Permitted Uses of GenAI

I ask you to do these things in this order when you can't figure something out:

1. Review the course notes.
2. Talk to your classmates.
3. Search for credible information online (e.g., StackOverflow).
4. Talk to the [Custom GPT](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-6783c8a8603c8191862f677689207682-dsst389-gpt) I created for this class.
5. If you use information from the Custom GPT, **cite** your interactions with it.

[This page](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/7925741-chatgpt-shared-links-faq) explains how to share a link to a ChatGPT interaction.

### Title IX

The University of Richmond and its faculty are committed to ensuring a safe and supportive learning environment. If you disclose to me or another mandatory reporter an incident of sexual misconduct (including sexual harassment or sexual violence), I am obligated by law to share that information with the University's Title IX Coordinator. For more information on our sexual misconduct policy, how to report, and confidential resources available to you, please visit the University's [Title IX help page](https://prevent.richmond.edu/title-ix/get-help/index.html).

### Religious Observance

Any student may be excused from class or other assignments because of religious observance. I will make reasonable accommodations when students' religious practices conflict with their academic responsibilities. If you will miss an academic obligation because of religious observance, you are responsible for contacting me within the first two weeks of the semester. You are also responsible for completing missed work in a timely manner.

For more information, see the University's [religious observance policy](https://registrar.richmond.edu/planning/calendar/religious-observance.html).

## Resources

The University of Richmond has many resources on campus that may help you succeed.

### Disability Services

The University of Richmond’s office of Disability Services strives to ensure that students with disabilities and/or temporary conditions (i.e., concussions & injuries) are provided opportunity for full participation and equal access. Students who are experiencing a barrier to access due to a disability and/or temporary condition are encouraged to apply for accommodations by visiting: [disability.richmond.edu](https://disability.richmond.edu).   Disability Services can be reached at <disability@richmond.edu> or 804-662-5001.

Once accommodations have been approved, students must 1) Submit their Disability Accommodation Notice (DAN) to each of their professors via the Disability Services Student Portal available at this link: [sl.richmond.edu/be](https://sl.richmond.edu/be). and 2) Request a meeting with each professor to create an accommodation implementation plan. It is important to complete these steps as soon as possible because accommodations are never retroactive, and professors are permitted a reasonable amount of time for implementation.  Disability Services is available to assist, as needed.

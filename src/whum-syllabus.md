## "What it is like to be alive"

### Description

Among many other things, literature tells us about what it is like to be
alive. Reading the literature of the past can help us see that question
in a historical sense: "What was it like to be alive then?" But it also
makes possible another question that readers ask themselves as they try
to relate to literature today: "Is this still what it is like to be
alive?"

This class reflects on these questions by reading epics, tragedies,
religious texts, narrative poems, and novels about people struggling to
understand their world and themselves. We occasion this practice of
reading by thinking about different answers to the question of why we
should read literature, reflecting on what good a practice of reading
does for ourselves and others. Throughout this course, we will develop
an understanding of the relationship literature cultivates between an
individual and their society, and how different literary forms attempt
to represent the particular and the universal.

## Goals

In this course, students will...

- Address the question of why we study literature

- Read major works of world literature

- Attend to the historical, cultural, and literary contexts of these
  texts

- Learn about the critical practice of close reading

- Learn about the genres and forms we encounter in this course

- Write and revise essays that analyze the central texts of this class

Watching film versions of the dramas can be useful, but is not required.
If you are going to watch *Oedipus* on film, I recommend the 1967
*Oedipus the King* starring Christopher Plummer. For *Macbeth*, I
recommend the recording of the 2010 production starring Patrick
Stewart.

## Assignments

Reading is your most important assignment in this course. The quality of
your reading will be assessed through three written responses, which
will be as follows:

### Assignment One: Structure

750 words. Due by 9 AM on October 1

Select one aspect of *The Odyssey* and reflect on how it affects the
poem's narrative structure. You may choose any aspect of the poem: a
character (e.g. Phemius), an object (e.g. Odysseus's bow), a social
practice (e.g. ritual sacrifice), a poetic device (e.g. Homeric
epithets), a place (e.g. Troy), an idea (e.g. loyalty to a spouse), a
narrative device (e.g. "meanwhile"), etc. Your essay must analyze this
aspect over its full arc within *The Odyssey*, from beginning to end.
What impact does it have on the world of the poem? How would the
narrative be different without it? Because this is a short essay, it
would be wise to choose a small aspect of the text.

## Assignment Two: Synecdoche

750 words. Due by 9 AM on October 22

In this assignment, you will be practicing a method of literary
criticism known as close reading. To do this, we attend to a very small
section of a work, reading it many times over in order to understand not
only what it is saying, but how it says it. This process often reveals
more about not only the passage in question, but also the work as a
whole.

Select a passage of no more than 100 words from either *Oedipus* or
*Genesis*. Read it closely. What does it say? How does it make you feel?
Which linguistic features cause those feelings, or advance its ideas?
What role does it play within the larger work of which it is a part? Is
it essential to understanding that work? If not, why is it there?

Whatever passage you choose, you must focus most of your analysis on
specific aspects of the text: its words, their etymologies, syntaxes,
discourses, etc. Less is, very often, more. It would certainly be
possible to write your whole essay about one well-chosen word.

## Assignment Three: Synthesis

2,000 words. Draft of introduction due Nov. 19. Due Dec. 23.

Your final essay synthesizes the approaches of the first two assignments
in one longer piece. Here, you will analyze one work from this course by
paying close attention to a few small pieces of it. You will reflect on
how the part or parts of the text you have chosen represent its world,
and the ways in which the people who live there relate to the world (or
its representations). Your analysis might be comparative (e.g. How do
the older and younger generations understand race in *Go Tell It on The
Mountain*?) and/or critical (e.g. Why is this particular passage
significant for understanding fate in *The Inferno*?) If you wish, you
may expand on your ideas, topic, or arguments from assignment one or
two. This prompt is deliberately broad: You may choose a text and topic
that are of interest to you. We will refine our topics as a class
through a drafting process.

To help you produce your best work, we will have three writing workshops
throughout the semester, one for each paper. During each workshop, you
will share work in progress with your peers. We will ask questions and
provide feedback for one another. Each of the workshops will run
differently depending on the requirements of the essay. For example,
during the first workshop on *The* *Odyssey*, students will share the
aspect of the poem they intend to write about, as well as what they have
learned about it through their initial reading and research.

- Plagiarism is "the practice of taking someone else's work or ideas and
  passing them off as one's own" (*New Oxford American Dictionary*). It
  is also a serious form of academic dishonesty prohibited under the
  CUNY policy on academic integrity. Failure to quote or cite an
  external source is a form of plagiarism, as is presenting one of your
  classmates' ideas as your own. Copying text directly from sources is
  only permissible if four criteria are met: first, that the writer
  attributes the source by using both quotation marks and an appropriate
  citation; second, that the source is of a suitable caliber for
  academic use; third, that it is quoted at reasonable length; and,
  fourth, that the citation is used to advance the writer's own
  argument.

## Land Acknowledgment

This class at the University of Virginia respectfully acknowledges the
custodians of the land we are on today, the Monacan Nation, and pay our
respect to their elders past, present and emerging. To learn more about
UVA's past and present connections to the Monacan Nation, I recommend
[this website](https://eocr.virginia.edu/monacan) from the Office for
Equal Opportunity and Civil Rights. To learn more about the Monacan
people, [read their

## "Empirical and Scientific Engagement" description

This course, one of four "Engagements" courses you'll take as a
first-year student, focuses on what we can learn from examining the ways
in which facts and evidence are identified, collected, analyzed, and
interpreted. Both within and beyond the university, you will encounter
claims about the natural and social worlds and be confronted with
situations that require you to evaluate and make decisions based on
evidence. Empirical methods are a crucial component to addressing and
answering such a broad range of essential questions. We will explore how
questions and hypotheses are formulated and evaluated.

## "From Language to Data" description

Targeted advertisements make people think that their phones are
listening to them. Getting an ad for something you were just talking or
thinking about feels uncanny. But your phone does not need to listen to
you to effectively target you. Targeted advertising fuels the internet.
And the successful transformation of language into data fuels targeted
advertising.

In this course, we study how and why people transform language into
data. What do we gain? What do we lose? We consider several types of
texts---including speech, digital communications, and published
texts---and many ways they get turned into data.

This course not only engages questions from academic fields like digital
humanities and computational linguistics, but also practical questions
of everyday life in the twenty-first century, from communicating with
our friends to researching new topics.

## Goals

By the end of this course, students will be able to...

- Identify and articulate insights from challenging readings

- Describe empirical evidence that can be derived from English-language
  texts

- Articulate strengths and weaknesses of empirical approaches to
  language

- Evaluate what we can know with respect to the digital cultural record

## Health

If you are sick and need to miss class, email me. Students who miss
class due to illness will receive excused absences and alternative
assignments.

## Grading

This class uses contract grading. Contract grading aspires to be more
transparent and equitable than traditional grading. It should motivate
you to focus on the course material instead of worrying about whether
you have a 92.4% or a 92.6%.

Here is how it works. You will tell me what grade you intend to earn.
Then, you will sign a contract stating that you will satisfactorily
complete a specific amount of work that will earn you that grade. You
can contract for an A, B, or C. If you do not satisfactorily complete
enough work to fulfill the terms of your contract, you may still receive
a D or F.

Read the contract for a full explanation.

- If you have obligations that require you to miss specific classes
  (e.g. away games), please let me know about them as far in advance as
  possible.

- Students requesting an extension due to *foreseeable* circumstances
  must email me 48 hours prior to the deadline.

  - For example, food poisoning is not foreseeable. A midterm for
    another class is foreseeable.

## Email

I reply to emails within two business days. If it has been more than two
business days, please write me again.

## Office Hours

I will schedule office hours in person or virtually at a mutually
convenient time.

## Engagements Experience

As a student at the University of Virginia, you are part of an exciting
and robust intellectual community. The goal of the Engagement Experience
(EE) is to make you feel welcomed into this community, where you'll
discover new ideas and meet fascinating people. The EE is part of the
Engagements program, existing alongside the Engagement course you are
currently taking.

The EE must be satisfactorily completed for *every* contract. There are
three components this spring:

1) Attend the Spring \'23 Engagements Experience Lecture

2) Complete an Academic Advising Activity

3) Complete an Engaging Grounds experience

### Component 1: Engagements Experience Lecture

Attend---either virtually, or in person---ONE Engagements lecture each
quarter. This spring, the second event is Eze Amos' talk about the
series of photographs he took on August 11-12, 2017 of the Unite the
Right and counter-protests. **The talk will be held on April 11^th^ at 7
pm in the Paramount Theater in downtown Charlottesville.** For those of
you who are unable to attend in person, the talk will be recorded and
you must watch that recording.

If you attend in person, you MUST plan to stay the entire time. This is
a chance to practice scholarly expectations, which include hearing all
of a talk and the Q&A.

### Component 2: Academic Advising Activity

As you approach the culmination of your first year at UVA, you will have
made significant progress towards the completion of the Engagements
Pathway requirements. You will have taken a course in each Engagements
pillar and made headway into completing your Literacy and Disciplines
Requirements. The EE will help keep you on track by asking you to
complete one academic advising activity during each quarter. These
activities will help prepare you for coursework in the following
semester.

Meet with your academic advisor

In advance of registering for classes for the Fall 2023 semester, you
must attend your scheduled faculty advising meeting. **If you have not
received a message from your advisor about scheduling these meetings by
March 27^th^, reach out to them to schedule something.**

### Component 3: Engaging Grounds

Each quarter you will participate in one Engaging Grounds experience.
You may choose which experience to complete from the curated list of
Engaging Grounds experiences below. Note that many options may be
completed at your convenience, but Scholar Speaks (on-Grounds lectures
or presentations) have a set date and time. See the
[calendar](https://gened.as.virginia.edu/engagements-experience) on the
Engagements Experience website for Scholar Speak Opportunities.

The list will be updated regularly throughout the semester. While you
have many options for completing this requirement, don\'t wait until the
last second as these opportunities are finite.

Engaging Grounds

The College Fellows have curated the following list of Engaging
Grounds experiences as a representation of the myriad of wonderful
opportunities you have as students at UVA. While we hope that you will
participate in each before graduation, you should select and complete
one for each Engagements quarter.

- Scholar Speak -- At UVA, faculty (both at UVA and invited from other
  universities) offer seminars, colloquia, and other forms of
  disseminating their original research on a regular basis. Select and
  attend a lecture or presentation from the calendar of events on the
  Engagements Experience Website,
  <https://gened.as.virginia.edu/engagements-experience>.

- [Enslaved African Americans at UVA Self-Guided
  Tour](https://vpdiversity.virginia.edu/sites/vpdiversity.virginia.edu/files/42425%20uva%20slavery%20walking%20tour%20map_revised%20July%202018.pdf) -
  After downloading the [\"Walking Tours of Grounds\"
  app](https://www.library.virginia.edu/map/walking-tours), complete
  this tour.

- A visit to McCormick Observatory where you participate in one of
  their ["Public Night"
  programs](https://astronomy.as.virginia.edu/public-outreach/observatory-public-night-program) or

- A visit to the piece of the Berlin Wall by Alderman Library after
  reading [this](https://news.virginia.edu/content/end-berlin-wall-no-simple-barrier-led-change-and-tumult) UVA
  Today article. Reflect on what it means to transport this piece to
  another national context and a public university, in particular.

- A visit to the former site of the George Rogers Clark monument.
  Read [this](https://news.virginia.edu/content/uva-and-history-race-george-rogers-clark-statue-and-native-americans) UVA
  Today about the statue's history and [this call for its
  removal](https://diy.rootsaction.org/petitions/remove-monument-to-genocide-that-welcomes-people-to-uva).
  What is this space like now?

- A visit to special collections where you will tour one of the exhibits
  and view one item from their collection in the reading room.

- A visit to the UVA gardens after exploring [these
  visualizations](https://juel.iath.virginia.edu/visualizations) about
  UVA at the time of its founding.

- A visit to the Rotunda *and*one of the Rotunda tours.

- A visit to the Fralin Museum where you view at least one of their
  special, rotating exhibits, *and*at least one of the exhibits that
  are part of the permanent collection.

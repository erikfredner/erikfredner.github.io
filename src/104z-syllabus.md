### Measurable Student Learning Outcomes

#### Course Specific Learning Outcomes for ENG 104Z

1. Explain how particular elements of fiction, literary devices, genres, and forms deepen our understanding of character or themes.

2. Describe authorial perspectives, literary movements, and literary forms that have shaped literary fiction.

3. Discuss literature as both shaping and reflecting the culture and context in which it was created.

4. Explore how literature helps us understand the human experience by connecting to our lived experiences and modern lives.

5. Defend literary interpretation with textual evidence and close reading.

#### Core Education / Bacc Core / WIC

This is a Core Education course that fulfills the requirements for the [Arts and Humanities: General category](https://coreeducation.oregonstate.edu/curriculum/learning-outcomes-criteria-and-rationale). In addition, this course also fulfills
the Baccalaureate Core requirements for the Arts and Humanities category.

1. Describe genres, forms, perspectives, events, and/or ideas that have
    shaped and recorded the human experience.

2. Analyze examples of human expression and/or human perspectives in
    changing cultural and/or historical contexts.

3. Employ humanistic, theoretical, and/or philosophical methods to
    explore the human experience.

#### Oregon Transfer Compass / Common Course Numbering Outcomes

1. Articulate how culture and context shape literary texts and how
    literature contributes to understandings of ourselves and the world.

2. Identify how literary devices and various formal elements contribute
    meaning to a text.

3. Build interpretations based on relevant evidence.

#### How these outcomes are fulfilled

This course fulfills requirements for the Arts and Humanities: General category does this in the following ways:

| Outcomes | How this outcome will be addressed | How this outcome will be assessed |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Describe genres, forms, perspectives, events, and/or ideas that have shaped and recorded the human experience. | Identify literary devices, stylistic choices, genres, and forms in stories and a novel, and consider how these elements shape the story and reflect the context in which it was written. Examples include stream-of-consciousness, irony, minimalism, American Gothic, postmodernism, and more. Discuss how authorial perspectives (including cultural and gender identities) and historical events (such as the Woman Question, WWI, Vietnam, and more) shape and are reflected in stories and a novel. | Defining and identifying literary elements will be covered in weekly quizzes and discussion boards. The Anthology Project asks you to place stories in literary context and make a case for their value in a lit class by examining their use of literary devices and their historical importance. |
| Analyze examples of human expression and/or human perspectives in changing cultural and/or historical contexts. | Analyze the meaning and impact of short stories and a novel from the last 200 years and multiple cultural contexts. Dissect texts as a sentence level through close reading. Discuss literature as both shaping and reflecting the culture and context in which it was created. Explore how literature helps us understand ourselves and our world by connecting to our lived experiences and modern lives. | The Analysis Essay prompts you to analyze themes or literary devices in the novel *Slaughterhouse-Five* (1969) and compare those elements with a story of your choice from another historical context. You will prepare for this essay with formative assignments, including Perusall annotation, a topic proposal, and a rough draft. |
| Employ humanistic, theoretical, and/or philosophical methods to explore the human experience. | Examine stories through a humanistic lens by discussing characters' motivations, relationships, and emotions in order to better understand the human condition. Apply theoretical lenses such as Marxist, feminist, post-colonial, and eco-criticism in our discussion of stories to better scrutinize the human experience. | The Character Project asks you to use humanistic, creative methods to explore a character of your choice. In this assignment, you will create and analyze a new way for us to see the character, through a text chain, illustration, podcast, or something else. This assignment asks you to explore characters as flawed, rounded, and relatable representations of the human experience. |

### Course Policies

#### Discussion Participation

Students are expected to participate in all graded discussions. While there is great flexibility in online courses, this is not a self-paced course. You will need to participate in discussions on at least two different days most weeks, with your first post due no later than Wednesday evening.

#### Late Work Policy

- Late assignments will be accepted with a late penalty of -10% per day.
- Late work may not receive instructor feedback.

#### Extensions

- Email me as soon as possible to request an extension.
  - For example, if a deadline in this course conflicts with your assigned jury duty dates, I would happily grant you an extension.
- Extension requests made within 48 hours of a deadline for foreseeable reasons will likely be rejected.
  - For example, if a deadline in this class conflicts with a deadline in another one of your courses, that is a foreseeable reason because both deadlines were available on the syllabi.
- Extension requests made within 48 hours for unforeseeable reasons will likely be granted.
  - For example, if you get sick, that would not be foreseeable.

#### Incompletes

When a requirement of a course has not been completed for reasons acceptable to the instructor and the rest of the academic work is passing, a report of “I” (incomplete) may be made and additional time granted, according to [Academic Regulation 17 of OSU Academic Regulations](https://catalog.oregonstate.edu/regulations/).

If you are having any difficulty that might prevent you completing the coursework, please don’t wait until the end of the term; let me know right away.

#### Statement Regarding Religious Accommodation

Oregon State University is required to provide reasonable accommodations for employee and student sincerely held religious beliefs.  It is incumbent on the student making the request to make the faculty member aware of the request as soon as possible prior to the need for the accommodation. See the [Religious Accommodation Process for Students](https://eoa.oregonstate.edu/accommodations/religion).

#### Class Participation and Building Community

Active interaction with peers and your instructor is essential to everyone’s success in this online course. I encourage you to please practice the following:

- Value the diversity of the class. Recognize and respect the experiences, abilities, and knowledge each person brings to our learning environment.
- Challenge others’ ideas with the intent of facilitating growth. Acknowledge your peers' contributions and highlight areas of further inquiry.
- Be open to being challenged on your ideas or prejudices.
- Practice self-awareness in your communication with peers and consider that your comments may hurt others unintentionally.
- Assume the best of your classmates and instructor and expect the best from them.

#### Content Warning

Literature often deals with difficult topics, including (but not limited
to) mental illness, violence, racism, sexual assault, war, trauma, and
death. We will discuss those topics as they arise in our reading. Please
consider whether you are comfortable reading and writing about those
topics this term. There won't be individual content warnings on each
story.

As a member of this classroom community, please be thoughtful and
respectful about how you write about difficult topics. Remember that a
fictional scene for you might be lived experience for someone else, and
it can be difficult to know how our words impact others. Please use
compassion and common sense when speaking about these issues in
discussion boards.

If you find one of our stories this term too difficult to read or discuss, you can contact me
for alternative assignments for the quiz and discussion board that week.

#### Academic Integrity

It is important that you understand what student actions are defined as academic misconduct at Oregon State University.  Refer to the [OSU Student Code of Conduct](https://scs.oregonstate.edu/) and the [Office of the Dean of Students](https://studentlife.oregonstate.edu/) for more information.  More importantly, if you are unsure if something will violate our academic integrity policy, ask your professors, GTAs, academic advisors, or academic integrity officers.

Academic misconduct, or violations of academic integrity, can fall into seven broad areas, including but not limited to: cheating; plagiarism; falsification; assisting; tampering; multiple submissions of work; and unauthorized recording and use.

##### Generative Artificial Intelligence

Student use of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) does not typically advance the learning goals in this course, which focus on developing the core activities of reading, thinking, and writing.

As a result, the use of any GenAI tools (including but not limited to ChatGPT, Copilot, or Claude) to generate or edit any portion of the substance of your work is not permitted unless explicitly noted in the assignment instructions. While this course recognizes that AI is increasingly embedded in everyday tools like [Microsoft Word](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/word/word-ai) and [Google Search](https://search.google/ai-in-search/), you are not allowed to use AI for your coursework beyond these limited non-substantive supports.

###### Acceptable GenAI Use

I allow one general use of GenAI because it advances the learning goals of this course.

Everyone encounters words, sentences, and paragraphs in literary texts that they do not understand. Often, this difficulty is inherent in the text because literature attempts to express subtle or uncommon experiences. In literature classes, we learn how to overcome such difficulties by facing them again and again. Usually, these cases require careful reading and thinking in order to arrive at an interpretation of what a text might mean. This kind of difficulty would not benefit from the use of GenAI because the "answer" that GenAI would provide would almost certainly differ from the interpretation you would arrive at on your own. Everyone needs to practice interpreting texts in order to distinguish between better and worse interpretations.

Other times, students face barriers to comprehension above and beyond what a text's imagined reader might face. This could the use of vocabulary or phrases that they do not know, or references to unknown people, places, or events. In such cases, students may use GenAI to aid their *comprehension*. By "comprehension," I mean that you get to the end of a sentence or paragraph, and think to yourself, "I don't understand this at all."

When facing a sentence or paragraph that you struggle to comprehend in this way, I ask you to do these things in this order. You may stop at any point once you have figured it out.

1. Read it twice.
2. Look up unfamiliar words or phrases.
3. Re-read it after looking up words or phrases that you do not know.
4. If you are still struggling, transcribe the passage, then ask this class's Custom GPT for help:

[**Custom GPT**](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-694188684cd481918fcf8f700673cd02-introduction-to-fiction-tutor)

The Custom GPT expects to receive a sentence, paragraph, or passage from a work of fiction, and has been instructed to help you comprehend the passage. I ask that you use this Custom GPT because its behavior should be limited in ways that benefit the learning objectives of this course rather than impeding them.

##### Turnitin

Your instructor may ask you to submit one or more of your writings to Turnitin, a plagiarism prevention service. Your assignment content will be checked for potential plagiarism against Internet sources, academic journal articles, and the papers of other OSU students, for common or borrowed content. Turnitin generates a report that highlights any potentially unoriginal text in your paper. The report may be submitted directly to your instructor or your instructor may elect to have you submit initial drafts through Turnitin, and you will receive the report allowing you the opportunity to make adjustments and ensure that all source material has been properly cited. Papers you submit through Turnitin for this or any class will be added to the OSU Turnitin database and may be checked against other OSU paper submissions. You will retain all rights to your written work.

#### Statement Regarding Students with Disabilities

Oregon State University is committed to making learning experiences accessible to all, which includes consideration of the course design, course learning outcomes, and barriers experienced by the disabled student. Disability Access Services (DAS) staff and students work together to determine reasonable accommodations. Students connected with DAS who have questions about their accommodations should reach out to their DAS Adviser. Students who have not yet completed the process for setting up accommodations, please contact DAS at 541-737-4098, visit [the DAS website](https://ds.oregonstate.edu/), or email <disability.services@oregonstate.edu> to explore accommodations for a disability (e.g., mental health diagnoses, chronic health conditions, learning disabilities, physical conditions/injuries, etc.). Students and faculty members are encouraged to collaborate around the implementation of accommodations.

#### Accessibility of Course Materials

All materials used in this course are accessible. If you require
accommodations please contact [Disability Access Services (DAS)](http://ds.oregonstate.edu/home/).

<https://asosu.oregonstate.edu/advocacy/rights>

#### Expectations for Student Conduct

Student conduct is governed by the university’s policies, as explained in the Student Conduct Code (<https://beav.es/codeofconduct>). Students are expected to conduct themselves in the course (e.g., on discussion boards, email postings) in compliance with the university's regulations regarding civility.

#### Student Learning Experience Survey

During Fall, Winter, and Spring term the online Student Learning Experience surveys open to students the Wednesday of week 9 and close the Sunday before Finals Week. Students will receive notification, instructions, and the link through their ONID email. They may also log into the survey via MyOregonState or directly at <https://beav.es/Student-Learning-Survey>. Survey results are extremely important and are used to help improve courses and the learning experience of future students. Responses are anonymous (unless a student chooses to “sign” their comments, agreeing to relinquish anonymity of written comments) and are not available to instructors until after grades have been posted. The results of scaled questions and signed comments go to both the instructor and their unit head/supervisor. Anonymous (unsigned) comments go to the instructor only.

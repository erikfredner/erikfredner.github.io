## Land Acknowledgment

This class at the University of Virginia respectfully acknowledges the custodians of the land we are on today, the Monacan Nation, and pay our respect to their elders past, present and emerging. To learn more about UVA's past and present connections to the Monacan Nation, I recommend [this website](https://eocr.virginia.edu/monacan) from the Office for Equal Opportunity and Civil Rights.

## "Engaging Aesthetics" description

This course, one of four "Engagements" courses you'll take as a
first-year student, focuses on aesthetics---that is, various kinds of
transformative encounters with art, literature, performance, and
environment. Sensibilities that we absorb from our social world, our
surroundings, and our experiences guide our views of particular forms of
expression and style over time, motivating how we engage with and
interpret our world. All of us----as makers of all kinds----design and
curate our daily lives and reinterpret our worlds. These aesthetic
interventions can reveal vital ways of thinking about our present, our
past, and about whom we might become in the future. A course in
"Engaging Aesthetics" is intended to help you:

- describe, analyze, and create;

- think critically about the nature of art and artistry;

- become aware of how aesthetic experience underlies social life and can
  frame our politics;

- reflect on the historical, geographical, and cultural differences that
  shape aesthetic expressions and hierarchies;

- and respond to and take stock of the moral and ethical capacities of
  the arts, both in everyday life and at moments of social, political,
  and environmental crisis.

## "Punching Up: US Satire" description

Satire makes the powerful feel weak and the weak feel powerful. It
ridicules hypocrisy and points out what we dare not say or think. By
showing us how foolish and absurd power can be, satire suggests that our
world can be otherwise. US satire skewers distinctions of race, gender,
and class as self-contradictory, yet undeniably real. Satire can be
poignant, too. As we all know, laughter sometimes ends in tears.

In this course, we study American satirists working from the nineteenth
century to the present. Students will learn about these texts and their
contexts, focusing on how form and content conspire to produce satire.
VÃ­ktor Shklovsky famously argues that great art "defamiliarizes" us with
the world. Perhaps no mode is more committed to defamiliarization than
satire.

## Objectives

By the end of the course, students will be able to:

- Explain what satire is and is not.

- Describe and analyze how satirical form and content interrelate.

- Reflect on the historical, geographical, and cultural differences that
  shape our responses to satirical aesthetics.

- Take stock of the moral and ethical capacities of satire at moments of
  social, political, and environmental crisis.

- Express original ideas in discussion, writing, and presentations, both
  individually and in collaboration with peers.

## Commonplace Book

You will produce evidence of your reading in a course [commonplace
book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonplace_book) on Canvas. For
each reading, you will write three or so sentences describing one
significant aspect of your encounter with the text. Your commonplace
book entries are *informal* writing, but they evince good reading.

Through this practice, we will develop a course culture of reading and
annotation. We will hold each other mutually accountable for good
reading through peer review of our commonplaces.

## Engagements Experience (EE)

As a student at the University of Virginia, you are part of an exciting
and robust intellectual community. The goal of the Engagement Experience
(EE) is to make you feel welcomed into this community, where you'll
discover new ideas and meet fascinating people. The EE is part of the
Engagements program, existing alongside the Engagement course you are
currently taking.

The EE is required for all contracts. Failure to complete the EE
automatically reduces your final grade in the course by one letter
(e.g., from an A to a B). There are three components:

1) Attend the Fall \'23 Majors' Fair as your Engagement Experience
    (more below)

2) Complete an Academic Advising Activity

3) Complete anÂ Engaging GroundsÂ experience (more information below)

**Component 1:** **Engagements Experience event**

[**Majors Fair**](https://virginia.presence.io/event/majors-fair-2)

**Tuesday, October 10th, 1-4 pm @ Newcomb Ballroom**

Stop by Newcomb Hall Ballroom to connect with more than 50 majors and
academic programs!Â Get your questions answered, and have a walk around
to explore your options, all in one place!Â Email Katie Densberger
atÂ <kad7k@virginia.edu>Â with questions.

Even if you think you know what you want to major in, we encourage you
to visit the Majors Fair with an open mind.

Note that you will have completed this activity at the end of Q1 just
prior to the start of your Q2 Engagement class, but it counts for Q2.

**Component 2: Academic Advising Activity**

The EE will help keep you on track with your general education
requirements by asking you to completeÂ one academic advising activity
during each quarter. These activities will help prepare you for
coursework in the following semester.

**Component 2:**Â **Meet with your academic advisor**

In advance of registering for classes for the Spring 2024 semester, you
must attend your scheduled faculty advising meeting. If you have not
received a message from your advisor about scheduling these meetings by
October 24^th^, reach out to them to schedule something.

**Component 3: Engaging Grounds**

Each quarter you will participate in oneÂ ***Engaging
Grounds***Â experience. This quarter, your Engaging Grounds required
activity is our visit to the Robertson Media Center to learn about
podcasting.

**Submitting the EE**

Attest that you have completed all elements of the Engagements
Experience by writing "On my honor, I have completed all components of
the EE" under the Canvas assignment titled "Engagements Experience" by
the posted deadline.

grading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contract_grading). Contract
grading aspires to be more transparent and equitable than traditional
grading. It should motivate you to focus on the course material instead
of worrying about whether you have a 92.4% or a 92.6%.

The main difference between contract grading and conventional grading is
that the difference between an A and a B is determined by *quantity*.
Higher amounts of effort yield higher grades.

Here is how the contract works: You will tell me what grade you intend
to earn. Then, you will sign a contract stating that you will
satisfactorily complete a specific amount of work that will earn you
that grade. You can contract for an A, B, or C. Earning an A requires
the most work; a C requires the least. If you do not satisfactorily
complete enough work to fulfill the terms of your contract, you may
still receive a D or an F. See the course contract for complete details.

## Email

I reply to email within two business days. Do not expect replies over
the weekend.

## Office Hours

I host my office hours by appointment to meet with all my students, not
just those who happen to be available during preset office hours. Speak
to me before or after class, or email me to set up a time. We can meet
in person or remotely as is mutually convenient.

## Health

If you are ill and may be infectious, please do not come to class. If
you are feeling well enough to come to class, please wear a mask.
Students who miss class due to illness will receive excused absences and
alternative assignments. Ideally, you should notify me of your illness
before the class you miss. However, if you are unable to notify me until
after class, please do so *as soon as possible*.

## "Artificial Intelligence"

Put simply, large language models (LLMs)---including OpenAI's ChatGPT,
Google's Bard, and others---use text from the internet to predict which
word will most likely come next given the prior sequence of words in the
prompt. LLMs do not "know" things about the world. Rather, they make
predictions about how words *might* go together based on their training
data.

Because a great deal of the text used to train ChatGPT and other LLMs
came from Reddit conversations, **I consider any interaction with an LLM
to be about as trustworthy as a random Reddit thread.** Sometimes Reddit
posts are excellent; mostly they are terrible. You would not and should
not cite Reddit as an authoritative academic source. You should use LLMs
in the same way and with the same degree of skepticism.

**If you do use LLMs,** all submitted writing must be your own original
work. Do not copy-paste. You are required to acknowledge your use of
LLMs through citation.

**How do you cite an interaction with an LLM?** If you use ChatGPT, I
encourage you to keep all of your conversations with it pertaining to a
given essay or topic in the same "Chat." Then, when you submit your
work, you can cite a single link to your interactions with the LLM about
this assignment. To do so, select the share chat icon (a box with an
arrow pointing up and out), copy the URL, and cite that URL in your
submission.

## Reporting Discriminatory Conduct

Per UVA policy [HRM-040](https://uvapolicy.virginia.edu/policy/HRM-040),
I am a Responsible Employee. If you mention prohibited conduct to me, I
am required to report it. Prohibited conduct includes, but is not
limited to, sexual and gender-based harassment and violence, bias and
discrimination/harassment, hazing, interference with speech rights,
threats or acts of violence.

If you experience or observe prohibited conduct, report it using UVA's

## Accommodations

In accordance with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), as
amended, and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, the University of
Virginia offers an array of individualized accommodations and services
to qualified students with disabilities. Accommodations are determined
using an interactive process between the student and Student Disability
Access Center staff. Contact the [Student Disability Access
Center](https://www.studenthealth.virginia.edu/sdac) with questions.

## Religious Accommodation

Students who wish to request academic accommodation for a religious
observance should submit their request to me by email as far in advance
as possible. If you have questions or concerns about your request, you
can contact the University's Office for Equal Opportunity and Civil
Rights at <UVAEOCR@virginia.edu> or 434-924-3200. Accommodations do not
relieve you of the responsibility for completion of any part of the

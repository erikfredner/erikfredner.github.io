Over several years, Mark Algee-Hewitt and I negotiated the first-ever release of approximately 1 million bibliographic records from _The Modern Language Association's International Bibliography_ (_MLAIB_), which describe scholarly monographs, edited volumes, and journal articles about literatures in English. This English-language literature subset represents about 1/3 of the _MLAIB_'s total records.

These records not only contain metadata about the articles themselves (author, press, journal, etc.), but also contain metadata about their contents as described by bibliographers (subject authors, subject works, genres, critical methodologies, etc.) using the controlled vocabularies of _The MLA Thesaurus_ and the Contextual Indexing and Faceted Taxonomic Access System (CIFT) designed to support the early digitization of the _MLAIB_.

A few articles have used small samples and derivative data from the _MLAIB_ before, but this will be the first-ever analysis of a comprehensive set of complete bibliographic metadata.

The article will describe large-scale trends in the recent history of English-language literary studies, with a special emphasis on the history of literary studies from 1982 to present, which is when the _MLAIB_ implemented its computationally controlled vocabularies for bibliographers.

This book is also designed to be a bridge: between quantitative and qualitative methods, individual and collaborative work, and the humanities and social scientists. Exploring Humanities Data Types with R does not presuppose background programming experience. Early chapters take readers from R set-up to exploratory data analysis (continuous and categorical data, multivariate analysis, and advanced graphics with emphasis on aesthetics and facility). Everything is hands-on: networks are explained using U.S. Supreme Court opinions, and low-level NLP methods are applied to short stories by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. The book's data, code, appendix with 100 basic programming exercises and solutions, and dedicated website are valuable resources for readers. The methodology will have wide application in classrooms and self-study for the humanities, but also for use in linguistics, anthropology, and political science. Outside the classroom, this intersection of humanities and computing is particularly relevant for research and new modes of dissemination across archives, museums and libraries},

Many data scientists use statistical methods but lack a deeper statistical perspective. If you're familiar with the R or Python programming languages, and have had some exposure to statistics but want to learn more, this quick reference bridges the gap in an accessible, readable format.

This Element argues that contemporary book culture is structured by practice that operates according to a White taste logic. By applying the notion of this logic to an analysis of both traditional and new media tastemaking practices, White Literary Taste Production in Contemporary Book Culture examines the influence of Whiteness on the cultural practice, and how the long-standing racial inequities that characterize Anglophone book publishing are supported by systems, institutions and platforms. These themes will be explored through two distinct but interrelated case studies-women's literary prizes and anti-racist reading lists on Instagram-which demonstrate the dominance of Whiteness, and in particular White feminism, in the contemporary literary discourse.},

This book takes a stand against a world that benefits some (including the authors, two white women) at the expense of others. It seeks to provide concrete steps for data scientists seeking to learn how feminism can help them work towards justice, and for feminists seeking to learn how their own work can carry over to the growing field of data science. It is addressed to professionals in all fields where data-driven decisions are being made, as well as to communities that want to better understand the data that surrounds them. It is written for everyone who seeks to better understand the charts and statistics that they encounter in their day-to-day lives, and for everyone who seeks to better communicate the significance of such charts and statistics to others. This is an example-driven book written with a broad audience of scholars, students, and practitioners in mind. It offers a way of thinking about data, both their uses and their limits, that is informed by direct experience, by a commitment to action, and by the ideas associated with intersectional feminist thought"--},

  abstract = {We analyzed Surveys of Public Participation in the Arts for 1982, 1992, and 2002 to see if trends in U.S. arts attendance are consistent with the perception of many sociologists of culture that the role of the arts as cultural capital is in decline. From a Bourdieuian perspective, a dramatic deflation in the value of the arts as cultural capital (the ``meltdown scenario'') would manifest itself in (1) large declines in high-culture arts participation rates (2) especially among the youngest cohorts that (3) are not evident in participation in middlebrow activities and (4) are concentrated among groups for whom cultural capital is most important, i.e. (4a) highly educated people and (4b) women.) Results are mixed. Trend data are not consistent with the meltdown scenario, but do suggest change in the position of different arts genres within cultural capital and ongoing attrition in the audience for many of the arts. Consistent with the decline perspective, younger cohorts' attendance rates have fallen for most high-culture performing-arts attendance activities. (Because college attendance increased in the 1960s, the decline is not visible in the middle cohorts until one disaggregates by education level.) In contrast to the decline perspective, however, declines are as bad or worse for several middlebrow cultural activities; attendance rates for art museums and jazz concerts have increased; and rates have declined more slowly for women and college graduates than for others. Two changes are evident: first, greater elite and general interest in the visual arts and jazz and less in classical music, ballet, and theatre (trends consistent with Peterson's ``omnivore theory,'' aspects of postmodern theory, and the notion that the content of cultural capital evolves over time); and, second, gradual decline among almost all age/gender/education groups in rates of attendance at live cultural events broadly defined, probably reflecting greater competition from at-home entertainment options and changes in population composition and family structure.},

Their field is one of exceptionally large and uncertain scale, subject to ongoing transformation and dispute and shrouded in copyright. It is, however, possible to produce an illuminating map of the field through statistical analysis of midsize, handmade data sets. On such a map one sees a striking shift in the typical temporal setting of the novel, a shift that corresponds to major rearrangements of the relation of literary commerce to literary prestige. This correspondence between formal and institutional developments in turn lends empirical support to the argument that, where anglophone fiction is concerned, the ``contemporary'' period begins around 1980.},

However, the biggest structural change has been a substantial growth in the number of anthologized authors. We argue that, while that strategy has produced real gains, it also creates a canon that less effectively manages reader attention, affords women and people of color a less valuable position than many white male authors once enjoyed, and tacitly accepts the notion that the new additions do not have greater literary merit than authors on the original roster, whom we show editors too rarely cut.},

Using this approach, I show how Hawthorne's work changed the vector semantics of US fiction. Readers of Hawthorne will be pleased if unsurprised to find his characteristic ambivalence reaffirmed by quantitative methods. More novel is the new evidence this method provides for measuring the ways in which Hawthorne distinctively differs from his peers. Because the model reveals which words Hawthorne embedded most similarly and most dissimilarly from his contemporaries, we can take these quantitative and qualitative differences in word usage as starting-points from which to address the question that began this abstract. The article concludes with a reading of Hawthorne's distinctive use of the word ``likewise,'' focusing on how it advances the satire of ``The Procession of Life.''},

No scholar has analyzed the discipline's contradictions as authoritatively as John Guillory, whose 1993 book Cultural Capital: The Problem of Literary Canon Formation remains a classic and whose subsequent essays on the profession of literary study have been widely cited. In this much-anticipated new book, Guillory shows how literary study has been organized, both historically and in the modern era, both before and after its professionalization. The traces of this volatile history, he shows, have solidified into permanent features of the university. Yet the discipline continues to be troubled by the relation between discipline and profession, both in its ambivalence about the literary object and in its anxious embrace of a professionalism that betrays the discipline's relation to its amateur precursor: criticism. In a series of essays, several previously unpublished, Guillory unpacks what it means to "profess criticism." His book gives a timely and incisive explanation for the perennial churn in literary study, the constant revolutionizing of its methods and objects, and the permanent crisis of its professional identification. It closes with a robust outline of five key rationales for literary study, offering a credible account of the aims of the discipline and a reminder to the professoriate of what they already do, and often do well"--},

But the advent of computational media has exponentially increased the pace, transforming how books are composed, designed, edited, typeset, distributed, sold, and read. N. Katherine Hayles traces the emergence of what she identifies as the postprint condition, exploring how the interweaving of print and digital technologies has changed not only books but also language, authorship, and what it means to be human. Hayles considers the ways in which print has been enmeshed in literate societies and how these are changing as some of the cognitive tasks once performed exclusively by humans are now carried out by computational media. Interpretations and meaning-making practices circulate through transindividual collectivities created by interconnections between humans and computational media, which Hayles calls cognitive assemblages. Her theoretical framework conceptualizes innovations in print technology as redistributions of cognitive capabilities between humans and machines. Humanity is becoming computational, just as computational systems are edging toward processes once thought of as distinctively human. Books in all their diversity are also in the process of becoming computational, representing a crucial site of ongoing cognitive transformations. Hayles details the consequences for humanities publications through interviews with scholars and university press professionals and considers the cultural implications in readings of two novels, The Silent History and The Word Exchange, that explore the postprint condition. Spanning fields including book studies, cultural theory, and media archeology, Postprint is a strikingly original consideration of the role of computational media in the ongoing evolution of humanity"--},

  abstract = {"Statistical Inference via Data Science : A ModernDive into R and the Tidyverse offers a comprehensive guide to learning statistical inference with data science tools widely used in industry, academia, and government. The first part of this book introduces the tidyverse suite of R packages, including "ggplot2" for data visualization and "dplyr" for data wrangling. The second part introduces data modeling via simple and multiple linear regression. The third part presents statistical inference using simulation-based methods within a general framework implemented in R via the "infer" package, a suitable complement to the tidyverse. By working with these methods, readers can implement effective exploratory data analyses, conduct statistical modeling with data, and carry out statistical inference via confidence intervals and hypothesis testing. All these tasks are performed strongly emphasizing data visualization. Key Features in the Second Edition: Minimal Prerequisites : no prior calculus or coding experience is needed, making the content accessible to a wide audience. Real-World Data : learn with real-world datasets, including all domestic flights leaving New York City in 2023, the Gapminder project, FiveThirtyEight.com data, and new datasets on health, global development, music, coffee quality, and geyser eruptions. Simulation-Based Inference: statistical inference through simulation-based methods. Expanded Theoretical Discussions : includes deeper coverage of theory-based approaches, their connection with simulation-based approaches, and a presentation of intuitive and formal aspects of these methods. Enhanced Use of the infer Package : leverages the `infer` package for "tidy" and transparent statistical inference, enabling readers to construct confidence intervals and conduct hypothesis tests through multiple linear regression and beyond. Dynamic Online Resources: all code and output are embedded in the text, with additional interactive exercises, discussions, and solutions available online at moderndive.com Broadened Applications : Suitable for undergraduate and graduate courses, including statistics, data science, and courses emphasizing reproducible research. Ideal for those new to statistics or looking to deepen their knowledge, this edition provides a clear entry point into data science and modern statistical methods"--},

A separate focus of NEA research has been to measure the ``value and impact'' of the arts for individuals and communities. Such studies often use experimental or quasi-experimental methods to understand the relationships between the arts and various outcomes of interest, such as in health, education, or community development. The COVID-19 pandemic's toll on arts organizations and arts workers has revealed some limitations to this twofold approach. The United States currently lacks a national arts surveillance and reporting system, one with sufficient data streams (approximating real time) that reliably can inform the sector about the health and vitality of its component parts, especially during economic downturns. Also lacking is a national clearinghouse of evidence-based practices that can appeal directly to arts managers. Although the NEA is not in a position to satisfy both needs entirely, the agency's development of a new strategic plan and research agenda has surfaced themes that will contribute to a far more practitioner-oriented set of research investments than the NEA has made in previous years.},

Its champions' ambitions extended far beyond the laboratory: psychological experimenters were keen to point out that everything in a modern society depended on the population's ability to read, and to read well. These scientists sought to reconstruct mass education, and the childhood experiences of millions of Americans were reshaped according to their maxims. They sought to transform mass capitalism, and, following a national campaign to boost "reading efficiency," the workplace experiences of millions of American adults shifted as well. They sought to place the defense of the nation on a secure footing, and so servicemen and spies were subjected to their science, from the heart of the Pentagon to the decks of aircraft carriers in the Pacific. By the end of the twentieth century, Johns argues, it would not be an exaggeration to say that modernity itself had been substantially shaped by the conscious application of the scientific study of reading"--},

  abstract = {This question of disciplinary meaning---which I ask from the viewpoint of the humanities generally---is larger than the question of disciplinary identity now preoccupying ``DH'' itself, as insiders call it. Having reached a critical mass of participants, publications, conferences, grant competitions, institutionalization (centers, programs, and advertised jobs), and general visibility, the field is vigorously forming an identity. Recent debates about whether the digital humanities are a ``big tent'' (Jockers and Worthey), ``who's in and who's out?'' (Ramsay), whether ``you have to know how to code [or be a builder]'' (Ramsay, ``On Building''), the need for ``more hack, less yack'' (Cecire, ``When Digital Humanities''; Koh), and ``who you calling untheoretical?'' (Bauer) witness a dialectics of inclusion and exclusion not unlike that of past emergent fields. An ethnographer of the field, indeed, might take a page from Claude L{\'e}vi-Strauss and chart the current digital humanities as something like a grid of affiliations and differences between neighboring tribes. Exaggerating the differences somewhat, as when a tribe boasts its uniqueness, we can thus say that the digital humanities---much of which affiliates with older humanities disciplines such as literature, history, classics, and the languages; with the remediation of older media such as books and libraries; and ultimately with the value of the old itself (history, archives, the curatorial mission)---are not the tribe of ``new media studies,'' under the sway of the design, visual, and media arts; Continental theory; cultural criticism; and the avant-garde new. Similarly, despite significant trends toward networked and multimodal work spanning social, visual, aural, and haptic media, much of the digital humanities focuses on documents and texts in a way that distinguishes the field's work from digital research in media studies, communication studies, information studies, and sociology. And the digital humanities are exploring new repertoires of interpretive or expressive ``algorithmic criticism'' (the ``second wave'' of the digital humanities proclaimed in ``The Digital Humanities Manifesto 2.0'' [3]) in a way that makes the field not even its earlier self, ``humanities computing,'' alleged to have had narrower technical and service-oriented aims. Recently, the digital humanities' limited engagement with identity and social-justice issues has also been seen to be a differentiating trait---for example, by the vibrant \#transformDH collective, which worries that the digital humanities (unlike some areas of new media studies) are dominantly not concerned with race, gender, alternative sexualities, or disability.},

Responding to laudatory claims about publishing's increased diversification and drawing on a corpus of book deal announcements, this essay considers the racial discourse circulating through the institutions that produce and promote contemporary literature: how are race and ethnicity represented by an industry whose controlling interests and presumed customers are predominantly white? Which stories, by which writers, make it through the bottleneck of acquisition---what traits do they share, what narratives do they promote, and what, by extension, are the "authorized" stories of race and racism in the United States? Even as more books by or about people of color are considered commercially viable, presumptions about audience demographics (including race, socioeconomic status, and gender) have led to the perpetuation of stereotypical narratives about race and ethnicity.},

  abstract = {"In the late 1950s, Random House editor Jason Epstein would talk jazz with authors like Ralph Ellison while pouring drinks in his office. By the late 1960s, he was poring over profit-and-loss statements. What happened? Beginning in 1965 after RCA bought Random House and then with subsequent purchases of publishing companies by multinational conglomerates, the business of publishing started to change. With more of an emphasis on rationalization, many publishers began to focus on genre and brand name authors. However, amidst a changing marketplace, other publishers found new avenues and possibilities to publish literary and experimental fiction. In Big Fiction, Dan Sinykin examines how changes in the publishing industry affected fiction and literary form. Beginning with RCA's purchase of Random House in 1965 to the invention of the Amazon Kindle in 2007, Sinkyin reveals how power situated in multinational media conglomerates and disseminated through the book publishing industry has influenced what kind of fiction and authors get published. In considering how publishers pursued profits and prestige, Sinykin examines four different sectors of the industry: mass market books and the rise of superstar authors such as Danielle Steel; the changing focus of Random House as a trade publisher; the rise of nonprofits such as Graywolf; and the employee-owned Norton. He also considers how women and writers of color navigated shifts in the publishing industry and allegorized their experiences in their fiction"--},
